<p>The southern tip of South America was one of the last regions of the world to be populated by modern humans, but the early history of settlement has remained murky.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09731-3">A new study</a> by Harvard researchers sheds new light on this mystery with the discovery of a previously unknown ancient lineage that endured for more than eight millennia and gave rise to a surprisingly diverse mix of indigenous cultures.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-39afe30d-b3b4-45d8-ac74-2e019e71112c">

<p>“We found this new lineage, a new group of people we didn’t know about before, that has persisted as the main ancestry component for at least the last 8,000 years up to the present day,” said <a href="https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/javier-maravall-lopez">Javier Maravall López</a>, lead author of the new paper and a Ph.D. student studying human evolutionary biology at the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “It’s a major episode of the history of the continent that we just weren’t aware of.”</p>



<p>In a paper published in Nature, a team of international researchers analyzed DNA from more than 230 ancient people going back 10,000 years in the central Southern Cone of South America, an area roughly bounded by the Andes Mountains, Amazon rainforest, and the grassy plains of the Pampas. Most of the DNA samples came from modern-day Argentina.</p>



<p>The southern tip of the Americas was one of the last corners of the globe reached by the diaspora of modern humans. The oldest firmly established evidence of human presence in the region is an archaeological site about 14,000 years old at Arroyo Seco in the Pampas of Argentina (when it was settled remains a hotly contested topic, and some scholars contend that the region was populated thousands of years earlier).</p>



<p>Previous genetic studies have shown that by 9,000 years ago Native Americans had begun to differentiate into three identifiable groups: one in the central Andes, another in the tropical lowlands of Amazonia, and a third to the south in the Pampas, Chile, and Patagonia. But much of the population history remained unknown, and studies of ancient DNA have lagged behind efforts in Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>“This part of the world was almost a blank spot on the map,” said <a href="https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/david-reich">David Reich</a>, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, professor of human evolutionary biology, and senior author of the new paper. “Like most of South America, there was very little data.”</p>



<p>In the new study — a collaboration of 68 co-authors across the globe — researchers obtained new samples of ancient DNA from bones and teeth of 238 indigenous individuals up to 10,000 years old.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-329de491-ff53-4c92-9650-9798c81c5286">
<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote has-green-color" style="--primary-page-color-bright:var(--color-green-bright);--primary-page-color-text:var(--color-green-dark);--primary-page-color-ui:var(--color-green);--primary-page-color-reverse-background:var(--color-green-dark);--primary-page-color-reverse-text:var(--color-white);--primary-page-color-reverse-ui:var(--color-white)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;This part of the world was almost a blank spot on the map.&#8221;</p><cite>David Reich</cite></blockquote></div>
</div>



<p>The new study boosted the number of ancient DNA samples from the central Southern Cone more than 10-fold. These new data were combined with existing ancient DNA from 588 other indigenous people from across the Americas who lived from 12,000 years ago up to the time of European contact.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the ancient DNA and focused on a select set of 2 million positions on the genome known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which vary between humans. With statistical analysis, researchers can make inferences about the genetic relationships among the individuals — and identify which ones shared common ancestry and which were more distantly related.</p>



<p>They discovered a lineage that appeared by 8,500 years ago and became the core component of the ancestry of central Argentina, mixing with other populations on its edges.</p>



<p>This finding is intriguing because the people of that region developed a diverse array of languages and cultures. Apparently, that diversity grew on home soil among largely homogeneous populations — not from migrations by other peoples.</p>



<p>“People with the same ancestry, in an archipelago-like fashion, were developing distinctive cultures and languages while being biologically isolated,” said Maravall López.</p>



<p>All told, the researchers found the region hosted at least three “deep lineages”: the newly discovered one in central Argentina, another present in the Andes by about 9,000 years ago, and a third established in the Pampas by 7,700 years ago.</p>



<p>This newly identified central Argentina lineage expanded to the south, mixed with the Pampas population 3,300 years ago or earlier, and, eventually, became the dominant ancestry.</p>



<p>In the northwest, the central lineage interbred with another ancient population from the Andes region, possibly by 4,600 years ago.</p>



<p>Researchers also found hints of the common ancestors of all these populations.</p>



<p>One person who lived in the Pampas about 10,000 years ago belonged to a population that already had become distinct from others in the Andes and Amazonia — and had genetic similarities to all later peoples in the Southern Cone.</p>



<p>In future studies, researchers hope to fill in the remaining gaps in the timeline and geography of these ancient Americans. In Europe, Central Asia, and China, researchers are building large databases with increasingly dense samples from specific places and time periods.</p>



<p>Reich hopes similar databases will be assembled in South America.</p>



<p>“With large ancient DNA sample sizes it is possible to learn details about the questions that really matter to many archaeologists — questions about how people are related to each other at a fine scale within archaeological sites as well as regionally,” he said. “With ancient DNA data technology now, it is possible to build refined maps of population size change and migration, as now exist in rich detail in Europe, and as this study begins to do for Argentina. Such maps are transformative for our understanding of how people lived long ago, revealing demographic information about the past that was simply inaccessible before.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>While past studies have explored how cancer patients’ <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1245/s10434-023-14200-0">financial health</a> influenced their risk of mortality, new research digs in deeper by zeroing in on objective data: <a href="https://www.facs.org/media-center/press-releases/2025/drop-in-credit-score-after-cancer-diagnosis-linked-to-increased-mortality-study-shows/">credit scores</a>. It found that when a cancer patient’s credit score drops — regardless of where it started pre-diagnosis — odds of survival decrease drastically. The findings were presented earlier this month at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress and have not been peer-reviewed.</p>



<p>Previous research relied on self-reports of financial burden, according to study author <a href="https://www.bidmc.org/research/research-by-department/surgery/surgical-oncology/benjamin-james">Benjamin James</a>, chief of general surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School. While helpful for understanding patients’ subjective experiences, such reports are prone to recall bias. It’s incredibly difficult to gather objective measures, James says, because clinical and financial data are housed by separate institutions with different privacy rules.</p>



<p>After years of negotiation, James and his team received deidentified clinical data from roughly 90,000 cancer patients in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry alongside financial information from a national credit bureau. The researchers adjusted for mortality-dependent variables, such as cancer type and stage, socioeconomic status, and race, and divided the credit scores into tiers (300-600, 600-660, 660-780, and 780-850). They found that patients who experienced a drop of two tiers within a year were 29 percent more likely to die. For those who experienced a two-tier drop within six months, that number increased to 63 percent.</p>



<p>In this conversation edited for clarity and length, James explained the implications of his team’s findings.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-squares"/>



<p><strong>You focused on credit scores — why is that?</strong></p>



<p>A credit score is a really good marker of somebody’s overall financial health. And, crucially, it changes over time. The crux of the question that we’re asking in this study is: What is the impact on patients’ long-term survival if they’re experiencing financial toxicity? If you get a medical bill that you can’t pay, or you can pay it but it means you’re going to have to refinance your home, is that more likely to cause you to die of your cancer than if you didn’t have that debt?</p>



<p><strong>So, what did you find?</strong></p>



<p>We looked at three main things. First: What is somebody’s mortality from their cancer diagnosis based on where their credit score started? What we found is that patients with a lower credit score at baseline were more likely to die. Now, that’s actually not very surprising, because that relates to social determinants of health. The literature has shown time and again that patients that are in lower economic status, that are of minority race — in general, they’re more likely to die. Sadly, that’s not a new finding.</p>



<p>The second question, though, was new: Regardless of where the credit score starts, if that score drops or increases in the 12 months after diagnosis, how does that impact their mortality? We adjusted for all those social determinants of health and just looked at the credit score. What we noted was that when a patient’s credit score dropped by two tiers, their mortality increased by nearly 30 percent.</p>



<p>And finally, when we looked at how the credit score changed over time on the <em>six</em>-month timescale, we actually saw an even bigger change. In this case, a two-tier drop was associated with a 63 percent increase in mortality. In other words, somebody getting the exact same cancer diagnosis has a 63 percent higher likelihood of dying just based on how their credit score is dropping.</p>



<p><strong>You found an association between credit score declines and mortality. What might be the reason for the link?</strong></p>



<p>I think there are lots of potential reasons. The obvious one, which may or may not be true, is that somebody is obtaining less care because they can’t afford it. And if they’re obtaining less care because they can’t afford it, they may be more likely to die of that diagnosis. The assumption is that if somebody is sick and they have cancer, we’re going to treat them. And that’s just not true. There are plenty of people out there who have to make financial choices that ultimately impact their survival. They may look at a family of four and say, I can either get this additional chemotherapy to improve my survival, or, you know, decide that I can’t cause this amount of financial hardship to my family.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48)">
<p>&#8220;The assumption is that if somebody is sick and they have cancer, we’re going to treat them. And that’s just not true. There are plenty of people out there who have to make financial choices that ultimately impact their survival.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other explanation, which I’m less convinced by, is that, as somebody is more likely to die, their credit score is more likely to go down — say, you stop pursuing treatment and you’re in palliative care, not paying anything, and then your credit score goes down. It’s chicken or egg: Are you more likely to die because your credit score is going down, or is your credit score going down because you’re dying? I don’t believe the latter is the main cause of what we’re seeing, however, because the vast majority of patients in the study do not have end-stage disease.</p>



<p>We can’t tease out the causes in this current data set, but we’re currently doing a prospective study where we’re surveying patients over time and collecting their financial data at the end of the study. So it’s a combination of both objective and subjective financial toxicity, in order to understand how they correlate with each other. We’re at the very beginning stages of that research, but that’s ultimately the way we’ll find out what’s really going on.</p>



<p><strong>What about if a person’s credit score increases? Does that have a protective effect, where a person is <em>less </em>likely to die?</strong></p>



<p>No, it doesn’t. The way I view it: Those who are able to pay things are able to pay things. So regardless of whether their credit score goes up, they’ll just continue to be able to pay for treatment. But at this point, we don’t really have a good explanation for why improving somebody’s financial health, particularly if they started at a lower tier, doesn’t seem to make a difference in their survival.</p>



<p><strong>How can cancer patients protect themselves from this huge increased mortality risk? Are there any ways to intervene?</strong></p>



<p>I think it all comes down to policy reform. That’s ultimately what we can do about this. I don’t personally believe that when people have medical debt that they can’t pay, that that should translate into an impact on their credit score. And so, there’s legislation out there about saying that medical debt shouldn’t be included in credit health. I think we also need to stop the aggressive, predatory collection agency practices of coming after you for your medical debt. There’s a bill that’s sitting with the Massachusetts legislature right now that makes the argument that we should not allow hospitals to sell medical debt to collection agencies. They should have to negotiate that on their own with the patient, as opposed to selling it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0">
<p>&#8220;I think it all comes down to policy reform. That’s ultimately what we can do about this.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, providing people with financial navigators at the start of their diagnosis is important. It’s very hard as a provider to have cost conversations with patients when they get diagnosed. We as providers don’t feel comfortable doing it&nbsp;because it’s a hard conversation to have, and it can feel like it’s not our responsibility; plus, we don’t know what the financial implications of their diagnoses are. But if I published this study, and a provider can look at this and say, “Wow, my breast cancer patient is more likely to die if their credit score goes down,” they may use that information as an awareness tool for their patients moving forward, which might allow patients to plan better for their diagnosis. You walk into the office, you get a cancer diagnosis, and you’re told that you have to start thinking about the finances of this as well, because it will impact your long-term survival.</p>



<p><strong>This research was conducted in Massachusetts, where 97-98 percent of the population has healthcare insurance coverage — one of the highest coverage rates in the country. Could these associations between financial health and mortality look even worse in other states where more people are uninsured?</strong></p>



<p>Whatever our findings are in Massachusetts, we have to assume that they would be substantially worse in most other states. If we are showing that patients are more likely to die as their credit score goes down, in a state where the majority of patients have health insurance, you can only imagine what would happen in other states that don’t have that kind of coverage.</p>



<p>That’s especially pertinent right now as we’re on the verge of 25 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage, depending on which way things go. These 25 million are the exact patients who are already at risk given their socioeconomic status, and most won’t be able to afford private insurance.</p>



<p>Even being insured doesn’t mean you don’t have out-of-pocket costs. Co-payments are going up dramatically. We know that <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/interactive-calculator-estimates-both-direct-and-hidden-household-spending/">11 percent of people’s spending</a> is on healthcare costs. And we know that of the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">$200 billion</a> spent annually on cancer care, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34698839/">$21 billion</a> of that is paid out of pocket by patients. People are making choices: Are they going to go into debt, or are they going to choose to not have the medical care that they need?</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Colorectal cancer diagnoses have become increasingly common in adults 50 or younger in recent years, particularly in high-income countries like the U.S. The drivers of the trend are unclear, but a new study led by Harvard and Mass General Brigham researchers, as part of the <a href="https://www.cancergrandchallenges.org/prospect">Cancer Grand Challenges PROSPECT</a> team, suggests an important link to ultraprocessed foods.</p>



<p>By analyzing diets and endoscopy results, the study of almost 30,000 women found that participants who consumed the highest levels of ultraprocessed foods had a 45 percent higher risk of developing adenomas, which can be precursors of early-onset colorectal cancer, compared with participants who consumed the lowest levels. The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2841354?guestAccessKey=f519cbac-0500-444e-a957-91e4ae77c2e7&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=111325">results</a> are published in JAMA Oncology.</p>



<p>“Our findings support the importance of reducing the intake of ultraprocessed foods as a strategy to mitigate the rising burden of early-onset colorectal cancer,” said senior author <a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/239720/Andrew-Chan">Andrew Chan</a>, a gastroenterologist at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute and a professor at Harvard Medical School. “The increased risk seems to be fairly linear, meaning that the more ultraprocessed foods you eat, the more potential that it could lead to colon polyps.”</p>



<p>The consumption of ultraprocessed foods — ready-to-eat foods that often contain high levels of sugar, salt, saturated fat, and food additives — has risen in parallel to the rise of early-onset colorectal cancer. Chan’s research group previously found an association between ultraprocessed foods and colorectal cancer more broadly, but this is the first study to link ultraprocessed foods with early-onset colorectal cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, a long-term prospective study of female nurses who were born between 1947 and 1964 — a generation that is known to be at elevated risk for early-onset colorectal cancer. They analyzed 24 years’ worth of data from 29,105 female nurses who received at least two lower endoscopies before they turned 50 to screen for colorectal cancer precursors. The participants also completed dietary surveys every four years, from which the researchers estimated their average daily intake of ultraprocessed food. Though diet was self-reported, this type of survey has been validated for its ability to accurately reflect a person’s dietary patterns.</p>



<p>On average, participants consumed 5.7 servings of ultraprocessed foods per day, which amounted to 35 percent of their total daily calories — slightly lower than the national average in the U.S.</p>



<p>From the endoscopy results, the researchers identified 2,787 participants who developed precursor polyps for colorectal cancer. Women who consumed the highest amounts of ultraprocessed foods — 10 servings per day on average — had a 45 percent higher risk of developing conventional adenomas, the precursor most associated with early-onset colorectal cancer, compared with those who consumed the lowest amounts (three servings per day on average). There was no association between ultraprocessed food intake and serrated lesions, another type of precursor, but one that develops more slowly and is less commonly associated with early-onset colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>“One of the strengths of our study was that we had detailed information about other colorectal cancer risk factors in the participants, such as such as body mass index, Type 2 diabetes, and low fiber intake,” said Chan. “Even after accounting for all these other risk factors, the association with ultraprocessed foods still held up.”</p>



<p>The authors noted that ultraprocessed foods do not fully explain the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer, and that they are working to identify other risk factors. They’re also working on ways to better categorize ultraprocessed foods, since some foods in this category might be more harmful than others.</p>



<p>“Diet isn’t a complete explanation for why we’re seeing this trend — we see many individuals in our clinic with early-onset colon cancer who eat very healthy diets,” said Chan. “Identifying other risk factors for early-onset colorectal cancer is one of the focuses of the work that we’re leading here at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute.”</p>

<p><strong>Thursdays in JP</strong></p>
</div>



<p>Every Thursday evening of the summer and now into the fall, our neighborhood gathers on the lawn of the historic Loring Greenough House in Jamaica Plain for food trucks, local brews, music, and activities hosted by local groups and organizations. It’s an easy, joyful way to spend time outdoors with friends and family, and — having small children — it’s a great chance for them to work out some energy while we actually get to engage in conversation with fellow adults. We feel incredibly lucky to have such a vibrant community tradition just down the street (and the beer trucks don’t hurt). Don’t let the promise of kids in attendance scare you, either, it’s well worth a Thursday afternoon trip down to JP to experience for yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Ogunquit, Maine</strong></p>
</div>



<p>Few places recharge me and my family quite like Ogunquit, Maine. Only about a 90-minute drive from Boston, the beach is gorgeous, with soft sand and huge waves. At low tide, mini tide pools form that warm up quickly, even in the colder months, and are a ton of fun to splash around in and hunt for sea life. The ocean views along the Marginal Way are spectacular in every season, and the town itself has a welcoming, inclusive energy. My family has celebrated many milestones there over the years, usually over an incredible meal from one of Ogunquit’s many standout restaurants. Between the scenery, the food, and the people, it’s one of our favorite places to be!</p>

<p><strong>Catching up on sleep</strong></p>
</div>



<p>As both a sleep researcher and a sleep clinician, sleep is my passion — and also one of my favorite pastimes when I can get enough of it. I spend my days (and some nights) studying how sleep shapes emotion, memory, and mental health, and helping others find the rest they need. Researching the sleeping brain is kind of like studying the ocean or outer space — there is a lot more unknown than known. While I do my best to prioritize sleep whenever I can, with young kids at home I’m often daydreaming about catching up on some much-needed “fieldwork” someday. Until then, I’ll keep making sure everyone else sleeps a little better, and maybe sneak in a nap when I can!</p>



<p>Looking to get a bit more sleep yourself? Here’s a tip: Caffeine has a six-hour half-life, which means that half of the caffeine in that 6 p.m. energy drink or Frappuccino will still be floating around your brain at midnight — not super helpful when you’re hoping to get the sleep needed to retain everything you learned that day!</p>

<p>A recent MIT Media Lab <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1">study</a> reported that “excessive reliance on AI-driven solutions” may contribute” to “cognitive atrophy” and shrinking of critical thinking abilities. The study is small and is not peer-reviewed, and yet it delivers a warning that even artificial intelligence assistants are willing to acknowledge. When we asked ChatGPT whether AI can make us dumber or smarter, it answered, “It depends on how we engage with it: as a crutch or a tool for growth.”</p>



<p>The Gazette spoke with faculty across a range of disciplines, including a research scientist in education, a philosopher, and the director of the <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/">Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning</a>, to discuss critical thinking in the age of AI. We asked them about the ways in which AI can foster or hinder critical thinking, and whether overreliance on the technology can dull our minds. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p>Many students use AI without a good understanding of how it works in a computational/Bayesian sense, and this leads to putting too much confidence in its output. So, teaching them to be critical and discerning about how they use it and what it offers is important. But even more important is helping them understand how their embodied human minds work and how powerful they can be when used well.</p>



<p>The work in neuroscience makes a compelling case that, while human minds are computational and use Bayesian processes, they are “better than Bayesian” in many ways. For instance, the work of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/antonio_damasio_the_quest_to_understand_consciousness">Antonio Damasio</a> and others highlights how our somatic markers enable us to make quick, intuitive leaps. Research from my lab found that kindergarteners used strategic information in playing a game that enabled them to make informed moves more quickly than a purely Bayesian approach. Further, our human minds can detect critical distinctions or exceptions to covariation patterns that drive conceptual change and model revisions that a purely Bayesian approach would sum across. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how human minds are more powerful than AI. There are many other examples (for instance, that while AI can offer analogies, to my knowledge, it can’t reason analogically).</p>



<p>In my “Becoming an Expert Learner” course, I aim to help students consider the wealth of research on how human minds work so that they can make the best use of their particular mind (with its normative and non-normative characteristics). Then I ask them to compare to AI to think carefully about when and how they decide to use each. I hope it leads them to a fuller appreciation for their incredible minds and abilities!</p>

<p>In the book I wrote with Ángela Pérez Albertos, we highlight that there’s no such thing as &#8220;AI is good for learning&#8221; or &#8220;AI is bad for learning.&#8221; I think AI can be used in ways that are good for learning and it can be used in ways that hinder learning.</p>



<p>If a student uses AI to do the work for them, rather than to do the work with them, there’s not going to be much learning. No learning occurs unless the brain is actively engaged in making meaning and sense of what you’re trying to learn, and this is not going to occur if you just ask ChatGPT, “Give me the answer to the question that the instructor is asking.”</p>



<p>At the end of the day, if you think you’re in school to produce outputs, then you might be OK with AI helping you produce those outputs. But if you’re in school because you want to be learning, remember that the output is just a vehicle through which that learning is going to happen. The output is typically not the ultimate goal. When you confuse those two things, you might use AI in ways that are not conducive to learning. AI can also hinder learning when students are overcommitted, overworked, and see AI exclusively as a time-saving device. But if AI can save you time doing the grunt work so you can devote that time to do more serious learning, I think that is a plus.</p>



<p>There are reasons to be optimistic and there are reasons to be worried about AI, but AI is here to stay, so it’s not like we can say, “OK, forget about AI.” We’d better figure out ways of collaborating with it and leveraging it in ways that advance our goals as educators, learners, and humans.</p>

</div>



<p>Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, is always portrayed with an owl on her shoulder. We now should ask, “Can AI be like the owl that helps us be wiser?”</p>



<p>I think the key to having the owl be a positive force instead of a negative one is not to let it do your thinking for you. We know that generative AI doesn’t understand the human context, so it’s not going to provide wisdom about social, emotional, and contextual events, because those are not part of its repertoire. However, GenAI is very good at absorbing large amounts of data and making calculative predictions in ways that can augment your thinking.</p>



<p>The contrast for me is between doing things better and doing better things. Ninety-five percent of what I read about AI in education is that it can help us do things better, but we should also be doing better things. One of the traps of GenAI, even when you’re using it well, is that if you’re using it just to do the same old stuff better and quicker, you have a faster way of doing the wrong thing.</p>



<p>If AI is doing your thinking for you, whether it’s through auto-complete or whether it’s in some more sophisticated ways, as in “I’d let AI write the first draft, and then I’ll just edit it,” that is undercutting your critical thinking and your creativity. You may end up using AI to write a job application letter that is the same as everybody else’s because they’re also using AI, and you may lose the job as a result. You always have to remember that the owl sits on your shoulder and not the other way around.</p>

<p>The course “AI &amp; Human Cognition” I teach aims to demystify AI, differentiate between human and machine intelligence, and explore the foundations of AI and how to use it effectively.</p>



<p>While AI excels in data processing and statistics, it lacks the ability to create truly innovative and creative solutions; machines calculate and they do not have human experiences. We have to remember that although AI machines work on sophisticated statistics, advanced mathematics, and use very fast electronic chips that operate at mind-boggling computational speeds, they rely on data that has been created by humans, and that data is the same, more or less, across the different AI platforms. When you ask a question to different AI platforms, most of the time their answers are very similar because the database is the same. AI can tell you how to put things together, but AI would not be able to help you build a device that relates to a human context. Machine learning depends on statistical adjustments, whereas humans self-organize life in relation to meaning.</p>



<p>AI can engage in processes that resemble critical thinking — data analysis, problem-solving, and modeling — but it has limitations. Critical thinking requires the human experience, the human insight, and ethics and moral reasoning. Machines today lack all of that, and their processes are only recursive.</p>



<p>I worry about students relying too much on AI. We have to remind students that we’re trying to help them become the future leaders of society, and part of developing leadership is to add new value to society; and that is a human enterprise. I haven’t seen AI do a really good system analysis and deep critical thinking. Today, at least, I find it very difficult to imagine that AI can have reflective thinking. We have to be careful not to think AI is going to solve our problems. Human challenges are complex and can be solved only by humans.</p>

<p>AI is forcing us to think differently about the various components of critical thinking. For instance, AI can be a helpful partner in analyzing and inferring, as well as with certain types of problem-solving, but it’s not always that successful at evaluating, and reflecting can’t (yet) be outsourced to AI.</p>



<p>It’s certainly possible to use AI in ways that diminish some of our skills, both lower-order capacities such as memory and factual knowledge as well as higher-order skills such as critical thinking. Just as turn-by-turn navigation systems have led to many us of knowing the streets of the city in which we currently live in far less detail than the streets of cities we learned before smartphones and car-based GPS systems were widely available, it’s likely that the ease of using LLMs will enable us to avoid engaging in certain challenging mental skills, and it will be difficult to persuade students to develop these skills in the first place.</p>



<p>The key is to use AI to assist us in learning and in thinking critically and, in the words of the American Historical Association’s recent “<a href="https://www.historians.org/resource/guiding-principles-for-artificial-intelligence-in-history-education/">Guiding Principles for Artificial Intelligence in History Education</a>,” “to support the development of intentional and conscientious AI literacy.” Some critical thinking skills will become more valuable because they cannot (yet) be outsourced to AI. The proliferation of “cheap intelligence” (more code, text, and images than ever before) means that the skills of discernment, evaluation, judgment, thoughtful planning, and reflection are even more crucial now than before.</p>

</div>



<p>I am very worried about the effects of general-use LLMs on critical reasoning skills. We already know that the tools we’re using during cognitive labor can change the ways that we do that work. We know, for example, that taking notes longhand <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-writing-by-hand-is-better-for-memory-and-learning/">leads to greater recall</a> than taking notes by keystroke, and that predictive text features built into word processors and email interfaces <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2020/05/predictive-text-systems-change-what-we-write">change our word choices</a>. Given these kinds of trends, I’d be stunned if frequent, multi-context use of LLMs didn’t lead to real changes in the way that users approach reasoning tasks.</p>



<p>The recent study from the MIT Media Lab provides at least some initial evidence for that. I am <em>less </em>worried about AI as an aid to guide expert-level reasoning in targeted domains, as when, for example, a doctor might use AI in diagnosis to ensure that she hasn’t overlooked an unusual disease. But the problem is that there is too much hype surrounding LLMs as general reasoners upon which we can (at least partially) offload our thinking about any topic whatsoever. It’s in the interest of people producing the technology to make us think that its possibilities are limitless and that it will usher in a wonderful new future for everyone. We should be cautious before we too enthusiastically pin our hopes on the latest technological trend.</p>

<p>Anthony Campbell, a law enforcement veteran dedicated to relationship-building in the communities he has served, has been named the next chief of the Harvard University Police Department (HUPD). He will begin his new role on Jan. 5.</p>



<p>“Chief Campbell brings extensive experience in public safety and law enforcement, coupled with an understanding of the residential, academic, and social aspects that make up campus life,” said Meredith Weenick, Harvard’s executive vice president. “Having spent his career as an officer and leader in law enforcement agencies, his track record reflects his personal and professional commitment to building strong, collaborative relationships between officers within a police department and their communities.”</p>



<p>Campbell’s law enforcement experience includes several years in leadership at Yale, where he currently serves as chief of police and associate director of public safety, overseeing more than 90 officers and 30 civilian staff members. He has worked to implement the Yale Police Department’s “fit for purpose” intentional response model, an approach that assesses a given situation to determine the appropriate response and resources to deploy. Additionally, he has prioritized the professional development of officers, ensuring access to quality training and technology, along with personal well-being.</p>



<p>Campbell first joined YPD in 2019 as assistant chief for operations for the division of patrol, a role that included the coordination of public safety operations for major events and oversight of the activities of community engagement officers.</p>



<p>“I am honored, both professionally and personally, to have been selected as the next chief of police for Harvard University,” said Campbell. “It is a privilege of the highest order to have served at the oldest campus police department in the United States here at Yale University, and now to have the opportunity to serve at the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, Harvard University, as chief of police is truly a dream come true. I look forward to working with the women and men of the Harvard University Police Department to ensure the safety of Harvard and the surrounding communities so that the values and mission of Harvard University can be carried out to their fullest extent.”</p>



<p>Prior to his leadership roles at YPD, Campbell was an inspector at the office of the state’s attorney in New Haven, a position within Connecticut’s division of criminal justice.</p>



<p>Campbell began his law enforcement career with the New Haven Police Department, ultimately serving as chief. Throughout his 21-year tenure there, he served in a variety of assignments, including director of the training and education division, officer in charge of internal affairs, and chief of staff. Under Campbell’s leadership, the city’s crime levels reached a record-setting low — which he attributed to effective community policing and relationships with local leaders and clergy — making it possible for additional focus on improving the quality of life for students, residents, and tourists in the city. Additionally, he fostered relationships with a diverse range of community organizations, such as the Yale Child Study and Victims’ Advocate/Survivors of Homicide Network, and led the development and implementation of various policies, including the application of new law enforcement technologies.</p>



<p>Outside of his role with YPD, Campbell works as an associate with The Healy+ Group to contribute to assessments for institutions related to the relationship between campus communities and the public safety agencies that serve them. He is also a lecturer at Yale Divinity School, teaching a course titled “Police Others as You Would Want to Be Policed: The Changing Face of Community-Police-Ministry Relations in the Twenty-First Century.”</p>



<p>Campbell has received several honors, including the Law Enforcement Leadership Award from the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, the Community Excellence Award from the Bereavement Care Network, and the Professional Partner Award from the State of Connecticut Department of Corrections Parole and Community Services Division.</p>



<p>Campbell earned his bachelor’s degree in religious studies from Yale University and his master’s in divinity from Yale Divinity School.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>The dream of creating game-changing quantum computers — supermachines that encode information in single atoms rather than conventional bits — has been hampered by the formidable challenge known as quantum error correction.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09848-5">paper</a> published Monday in Nature, Harvard researchers demonstrated a new system capable of detecting and removing errors below a key performance threshold, potentially providing a workable solution to the problem.</p>



<p>“For the first time, we combined all essential elements for a scalable, error-corrected quantum computation in an integrated architecture,” said <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/lukin">Mikhail Lukin</a>, co-director of the Quantum Science and Engineering Initiative, Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor, and senior author of the new paper. “These experiments — by several measures the most advanced that have been done on any quantum platform to date — create the scientific foundation for practical large-scale quantum computation.”</p>



<p>In the new paper, the team demonstrated a “fault tolerant” system using 448 atomic quantum bits manipulated with an intricate sequence of techniques to detect and correct errors.</p>



<p>The key mechanisms include physical entanglement, logical entanglement, logical magic, and entropy removal. For example, the system employs the trick of “quantum teleportation” — transferring the quantum state of one particle to another elsewhere without physical contact.</p>



<p>“There are still a lot of technical challenges remaining to get to very large-scale computer with millions of qubits, but this is the first time we have an architecture that is conceptually scalable,” said lead author Dolev Bluvstein, Ph.D. ’25, who did the research during his graduate studies at Harvard and is now an assistant professor at Caltech. “It’s going to take a lot of effort and technical development, but it’s becoming clear that we can build fault-tolerant quantum computers.”</p>



<p>The Harvard-led collaboration included researchers from MIT and was jointly headed by Lukin; <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/greiner">Markus Greiner</a>, George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics; and <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/vladan-vuletic/">Vladan Vuletić</a>, Lester Wolfe Professor of Physics at MIT. The team conducts research in collaboration with QuEra Computing, a startup company spun out from Harvard-MIT labs, the Joint Quantum Institute at University of Maryland, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>



<p>The new paper represents an important advance in a three-decade pursuit of quantum error correction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)"><blockquote><p>“In the end, physics is an experimental science. By realizing and testing these fundamental ideas in a lab, you really start seeing light at the end of the tunnel.”</p><cite>Mikhail Lukin</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Conventional computers encode information in a binary code of zeros and ones. Quantum computers store information in subatomic particles whose counterintuitive properties of quantum physics can achieve far more processing power.</p>



<p>In a conventional computer, the most basic unit of information is a “bit” (short for binary digit); in quantum systems, the basic unit is a “qubit” (or quantum bit).</p>



<p>In conventional computers, doubling the number of bits doubles the processing power; in quantum systems, adding qubits exponentially increases the power because of a phenomenon called quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>In theory, a system of 300 quantum bits can store more information than the number of particles in the known universe.</p>



<p>With such vast power, quantum computers have the potential to deliver breakthroughs in fields such as drug discovery, cryptography, machine learning, artificial intelligence, finance, and material design.</p>



<p>But there are hurdles to realizing that revolutionary potential. Chief among them is the error rate. Qubits are inherently susceptible to slipping out of their quantum states and losing their encoded information, making error correction a core prerequisite to achieving large quantum machines.</p>



<p>In the new paper, the team combined various methods to create complex circuits with dozens of error correction layers. The system suppresses errors below a critical threshold — the point where adding qubits further reduces errors rather than increasing them.</p>



<p>“There have been many important theoretical proposals for how you should implement error correction,” said Alexandra Geim, one of the lead authors on the new paper and a Ph.D. student in physics in the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “In this paper, we really focused on understanding what are the core mechanisms for enabling scalable, deep-circuit computation.&nbsp;By understanding that, you can essentially remove things that you don’t need, reduce your overheads, and get to a practical regime much faster.”</p>



<p>Lukin said years of experiments showed how to overcome some technical challenges and avoid others.</p>



<p>“We realize which of these bottlenecks are real and which bottlenecks you just can bypass,” he said. “In the end, physics is an experimental science. By realizing and testing these fundamental ideas in a lab, you really start seeing light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>



<p>Researchers around the world are studying a variety of potential platforms for qubits, including different types of atoms, ions, and superconducting qubits.</p>



<p>The Harvard team specializes in neutral atoms (those with no electrical charge because they have equal numbers of protons and electrons) of the element rubidium. They use lasers to change the configuration of electrons to encode the atoms to become information-carrying qubits.</p>



<p>Hartmut Neven, vice president of engineering at the Google Quantum AI team, said the new paper came amid an “incredibly exciting” race between qubit platforms.</p>



<p>“This work represents a significant advance toward our shared goal of building a large-scale, useful quantum computer,” he said.</p>



<p>In September, the Harvard-MIT-QuEra group published another Nature paper demonstrating a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/clearing-significant-hurdle-to-quantum-computing/">system of more than 3,000 qubits</a> that could operate continuously for more than two hours and overcome another technical hurdle of atom loss.</p>



<p>With recent advances, Lukin believes the core elements for building quantum computers are falling into place.</p>



<p>“This big dream that many of us had for several decades, for the first time, is really in direct sight,” he said.</p>

<p>This research received federal funding from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, Department of Energy, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, Army Research Office, National Science Foundation, and National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-right is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-f1f2ed93 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>U.S. colleges and universities have for the most part done a good job protecting and promoting campus discourse in recent years, according to Princeton President <a href="https://president.princeton.edu/about-office/christopher-l-eisgruber-president">Christopher Eisgruber</a>. They have not, however, escaped the divisions affecting institutions and communities across the country.</p>



<p>“There’s a genuine civic crisis in America,” Eisgruber said in a conversation with David Deming, Danoff Dean of Harvard College, on Nov. 5 at Sanders Theatre. “It is true that all of us are having a harder time talking to one another now than we had in the past, and that’s true for colleges as well. What I deny is that colleges or the younger generation are doing worse in that kind of environment.”</p>



<p>Eisgruber’s new book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/christopher-l-eisgruber/terms-of-respect/9781541607453/">“Terms of Respect: How Colleges Get Free Speech Right,”</a><em> </em>reflects on lessons he’s learned as the leader of Princeton for more than a decade, and during rising U.S. polarization. In his talk with Deming, he expanded on themes covered in the book and spoke from experience, some of it sharp-edged, on the challenges of handling campus tensions in real time.</p>



<p>Among them: headline-grabbing student protests of campus speakers at schools across the country. At Princeton, Eisgruber supports faculty and student efforts to welcome speakers who challenge status-quo views. He’s not interested, however, in promoting empty provocations or people who seem interested only in fueling the flames of conflict.</p>



<p>Scholars and students “have tremendous freedom to make those invitations,” he said. “Inviting noted political figures to campus who are very controversial can be a very valuable thing for people to do. Inviting people who are coming as provocateurs, I think, is a much less valuable thing to do.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-e18e953a-08fa-42a9-890b-c6a2633ef0bc">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Inviting noted political figures to campus who are very controversial can be a very valuable thing for people to do. Inviting people who are coming as provocateurs, I think, is a much less valuable thing to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>An area where colleges have stumbled is in balancing the right to protest with their obligation to maintain a safe and productive campus environment, Eisgruber said, pointing specifically to a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/agreement-ends-student-occupation-of-nassau-hall-in-princeton/">student occupation of a Princeton building</a> during a 2015 Black Justice League protest. The university faltered, he said, by allowing the demonstration to interfere with everyday operations.</p>



<p>“I think maintaining that constructive environment where everybody feels like they can be a part of the conversation on equal terms means that when there’s a disruption going on in the university’s business, and you’ve got a set of rules, and your rules say this is the point where you have to leave, you have to enforce them,” he said.</p>



<p>Even so, he argued, campus protests demonstrate a sustained commitment to free speech on the part of universities — not the other way around.</p>



<p>“When you have a really great free speech environment, which I maintain Harvard does, you’re going to get controversy on the campus, which means sometimes you’re going to see disruptions,” he said. “That’s not the right way to count free speech. If I’m an accountant — what do I want to look for? I want to look for engagement. I want to look for argument. I want to look for controversy.”</p>



<p>Engagement, argument, and controversy remain alive and well on U.S. campuses, he said, but are now under pressure and scrutiny that grow more intense as social media and other forces stoke conflict.</p>



<p>“Colleges get free speech right through millions of conversations like this one or ones that take place in dorm rooms or dining hall tables or at public events or classrooms in colleges and universities across the United States every year.</p>



<p>“We are in a time in America when it’s hard to have the conversations that really matter. We’re in a time in America characterized by extreme polarization that leads people to demonize folks who are on the other side of arguments, and we’re at a time in America when social media has created different kinds of incentives that make constructive conversation difficult.”</p>

<p>Steven J. Zipperstein was on the verge of starting rabbinical school when he came across an early excerpt from Philip Roth’s trailblazing novel “Portnoy’s Complaint” about a young Jewish bachelor and his obsession with sex.</p>



<p>It was a reading that taught the young Zipperstein, who grew up in a Jewish Orthodox family in Los Angeles and was wrestling with cultural and religious expectations, crucial lessons about both the nature and the intricacies of freedom.</p>



<p>Zipperstein made a reference to the lasting impact of that early reading of “Portnoy’s Complaint” during a recent Harvard talk about his new biography, “<a href="https://www.jewishlives.org/books/philiproth?srsltid=AfmBOooqPl7MYBobknieXbOHeayR0BgInvTY4I1nboiIrYIsdBRwQEgj">Philip Roth: Stung by Life</a>,” with Rebecca Goldstein, a MacArthur-winning writer of novels and nonfiction, and a research associate in the Department of Psychology. The event was co-sponsored by the <a href="https://cjs.fas.harvard.edu/">Center for Jewish Studies</a> at Harvard and the Jewish Cultures and Societies Seminar at the Mahindra Humanities Center.</p>



<p>“What I realized was that the book was not about the happy life of a libertine, but it was about someone with all the freedom in the world who was a neurotic,” said Zipperstein, the Daniel E. Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University.</p>



<p>“It taught me something about the world I was yearning to enter into. It taught me that if I was to leave orthodoxy, I was not entering panacea or utopia. His voice remained with me.”</p>

<p>Zipperstein left orthodoxy and became a historian of Judaism and Jewish culture and a longtime admirer of Roth for his “honesty to confront life,” for being both “an incredibly serious writer and unbelievably funny,” and for his relentless examination of the Jewish American experience. Zipperstein writes of Roth, “He would probe nearly every aspect of contemporary Jewish life: the passions of Jewish childhood, the pleasures and anguish of postwar Jewish suburbia, Israel, diaspora, the Holocaust, circumcision, the interplay between the nice Jewish boy and the turbulent one deep inside.”</p>



<p>A formidable and prolific author who won numerous literary awards, Roth wrote 31 books, among them “Goodbye, Columbus,” “The Ghost Writer,” “The Plot Against America,” “American Pastoral,” “I Married a Communist,” and “The Human Stain.” When Roth died in 2018 at age 85, he was described in a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/obituaries/philip-roth-dead.html">obituary</a> as a “pre-eminent figure in 20th-century literature,” and a “towering novelist who explored lust, Jewish life and America.”</p>



<p>Around the time when Zipperstein’s biography on writer Isaac Rosenfeld came out, Roth reached out to Zipperstein saying that he was on a “quest to find a biographer,” said Zipperstein. In 2021, a biography of Roth authored by Blake Bailey was quickly pulled from publication in the wake of accusations of sexual misconduct against Bailey. After that, there was a need for a new biographical study of Roth, Zipperstein wrote in his book, “all the more so since few contemporary writers have shown themselves to be quite as self-referential as Roth, and few self-referential writers have managed, for so very long, to be quite cagey, so slippery.”</p>



<p>Zipperstein’s book, which published in October, draws from interviews with more than 100 friends and family members, dozens of archival materials, and conversations with Roth himself about his life and work.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-ce670faf-2555-48cd-9b89-c24b561c0f3c">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“He decided sometime in his 20s that he was going to be as great a writer as Melville, and I think he felt that there wasn’t a whole lot of discretionary time for emotional involvement.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>“One of the reasons why he trusted me is that he knew that I really loved his prose, and that I was going to write a book that centered around his prose, because that’s really all he cared about,” said Zipperstein. “I never tired of reading his work.”</p>



<p>Asked about how he came to terms with the accusations of misogyny against Roth, Zipperstein said Roth avoided emotional ties with women and even male friends because he put more time and energy in writing his books than in any human relationship.</p>



<p>“He decided sometime in his 20s that he was going to be as great a writer as Melville, and I think he felt that there wasn’t a whole lot of discretionary time for emotional involvement,” said Zipperstein. “He was involved romantically with several extraordinary women, but as one of them told me, ‘As soon as we began to demonstrate needs, he disappeared.’”</p>



<p>In writing a biography built on the interaction between Roth’s life and his work, Zipperstein said he approached the endeavor without the need to reconcile the writer’s contradictions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“He was someone who took offense so quickly, and yet he took incredible fictional risks,” said Zipperstein. “I was surprised by the extent to which he extended himself for friends but not to his close family. I ended up being probably closer to first cousins of his than he was. And yet, he built book after book around family. How do I reconcile that with his indifference to most of his relatives? I can’t, but one doesn’t have to reconcile everything in biography.”</p>



<p>In the end, Roth’s true devotion was to his craft, said Zipperstein. As he writes in his biography, “There was nothing of greater importance to Roth than his books, his true loves, and that is the only reason that justifies spending years of one’s own life writing and rewriting a book about him.”</p>

<p>Gazette photographer Stephanie Mitchell returns for the final edition of the experiment she has been conducting with six College seniors ever since they arrived at Harvard. Inspired by Nora Ephron, who told her Wellesley College graduating in 1996, “You are not going to be you, fixed and immutable you, forever,” Mitchell met with undergrads during the first week of their <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/10/harvard-first-years-describe-themselves-in-three-words/">first year</a>, <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/10/sophomores-reflect-on-how-theyve-changed-in-a-year/">sophomore year</a>, and then <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/11/harvard-juniors-describe-themselves-in-3-words/">junior year</a>, photographing and asking each to describe themselves in three words. Now in their final year, the students participated in the exercise for the last time. Tracing from their first year, the three words they select appear in gray (2022), dark gray (2023), brown (2024), and black (2025).<strong></strong></p>

<p>Each year, Sofia Chavez included “free” and “independent” in her descriptors, and this year, she added “curious.” “I’m curious to be out in the world as a student, but more now as part of society, as a citizen. Now, I’m more curious than ever, and that excites me,” she said.</p>



<p>Settling into senior year, Chavez, who is a government concentrator, has been preparing to write her senior thesis about politics and the judiciary system in Mexico. She honed her writing skills in a junior seminar, incrementally writing longer papers and focusing on how to organize and defend ideas — “a transformative experience.” Many of her closest friends are also writing theses and she expects they will bond over the process. “It’s formidable, but I’m really, really excited.”</p>



<p>Reflecting on personal change she has felt since her first year, she said, “I was very worried that I need to be perfect … now I feel mistakes and hard situations build character, and that character is the tool you need to face the world outside.” She respects people who make mistakes and carry on.&nbsp; “It shows resilience, and it shows courage,” she said.</p>



<p>Initially scared to leave her home in Mexico, she now feels a sense of pride in her family values and traditions and carries them wherever she goes. “Paradoxically, being away from home connected me more with home … I only noticed that once I left and it gave me perspective. … It is not something that I can acquire in reading a book or in a text, but only through experience.”</p>

<p>Zimbabwe native Bradley Chinhara chose “God-loving” as his first word all four years —“That one is never going to change” — and this year added “Intentional” and “Bold.” “I’ve been trying to take more control of my life. Think things through before I do them. Be intentional with the people in my life, my relationships, my faith, and my work. … I’ve been teaching myself to learn to be uncomfortable and to be courageous and do things even though I’m scared or even though I’m anxious,” he said.</p>



<p>Chinhara’s mother died the summer before his junior year. To help with the grieving process, he kept busy the fall semester with academics from his computer science concentration, rugby, and extracurriculars such as Harvard Product Lab and Harvard African Students Association. “It was overwhelming, but it was a good way to keep myself going, because I had so much to do.” His circle of close friends was essential.</p>



<p>Reflecting on his four years, Chinhara shared: “I thought I knew stuff, because most of that stuff was dreams, goals, a lot of excitement, and that’s good. It’s good energy to have for a freshman. Now that I’m a senior, now that I’ve experienced classes, extracurriculars, social relationships, I’ve pursued my faith even more, I’m more composed, more settled into those dreams. I’m more aware of what I need to do in order to succeed, in order to have healthy relationships, in order to take care of my mental health.”</p>



<p>“I’m grateful for how I’ve held onto my values and morals, that stayed as a constant. I always tell my friends, before you go out and try something in college ask yourself, am I growing or changing? If you’re changing, maybe reconsider doing it, if you’re growing, then do it,” he said. “I’ve focused on growing but not changing my values.”</p>



<p>“Freshman year, my mom was still alive, and senior year, my mom’s not here anymore, and she was the most important person in my entire life. I want anything and everything I do from here to be in honor of her. I want to try my hardest to succeed, to be a good role model for my little brother, and to do her proud.”</p>

<p>As she rounds the corner to her senior year, Riley Flynn, who comes from Phoenix, feels grateful. “I’ve met all these incredible people that I get to call my best friends from classes, school, softball, and athletics.” She is hopeful for the future and proud of how far she has come since her first year.</p>



<p>Being on the softball team all four years has provided helpful perspective. “I could see our freshmen come in every year and relive those freshman-year feelings, and that has really helped me keep grounded.”</p>



<p>As a human development and regenerative biology concentrator, junior year was “the year of organic chemistry … a defining moment in every STEM concentrators’ years here.” She pushed through the difficult semesters by bonding with her classmates, and in a dynamic stem cell class where she was able to witness all three parts of healthcare (research, doctors, and patients), which solidified her resolve to continue in the field.</p>



<p>She finds herself still working through future plans and being content with this. “I am just focused on being grateful for being here and trust in the process,” she said. “I know where I want to go, and if it’s not, then I will reassess and change.”</p>

<p>Over the last year, Dara Omoloja, who calls Milwaukee home, embarked upon a faith journey, became Christian, and at Easter was baptized. “The way God has worked in my life in the past year has been really extreme,” she shared. “I trust in something that’s bigger and stronger than myself.”</p>



<p>Having finished her pre-med requirements and nearly done with her neuroscience concentration requirements, she is planning to complete her academic requirements and also go on as many trips as possible, exploring local museums, Cape Cod, and Six Flags amusement park, as well as taking trips to New York and Mexico.</p>



<p>Considering her years at Harvard, Omoloja said, “I’m the closest ever to knowing who I am … I feel College is really that experience of discovering what makes you, you. … It is a transformative experience, and years that really do shape you for the rest of your life. I would have been a completely different person if I didn’t go here.”</p>



<p>Thinking back to her first days as a first-year, she shared, “I was still a people pleaser, deeply insecure, and I think I changed for the better in that way. I truly embrace my flaws and the things that I am good at. I’m just more authentic, and that brings me a lot more peace.”</p>

<p>Lowell House</p>
</div>



<p>At the start of his final year, Austin Wang, from Waterloo, Canada, feels mixed emotions — both excited for the possibilities ahead and surprised by how quickly his College years have passed.</p>



<p>He has continued with activities such as ringing the Lowell House bells every Sunday morning and volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, the latter being “really rewarding, definitely the most impactful thing I do.”</p>



<p>Wang, who is studying chemical and physical biology with a secondary in computer science, is preparing a thesis project where he will “image how cells eat stuff,” a process that is not well understood. “It’s a good mix of comp bio and bench work. I’ve always loved microscopy a lot.”</p>



<p>During junior year, he branched out from his concentration and enjoyed a wide variety of studies, including learning how to make books with binding techniques taught at the Weisman Preservation Center and participating in a creative writing workshop with senior lecturer and fiction writer Paul Yoon.</p>



<p>Reflecting on how he’s changed, Wang said: “I don’t think I was super confident that first year. I didn’t really talk a lot … I definitely grew a lot in College, and hopefully that continues. I’ve also stayed the same in some ways … definitely a bit more mature.”</p>

<p>“I’m a naturally sentimental person,” said Myra Bhathena, a native of Andover, Massachusetts. “As a senior, it’s making everything a little bit more sentimental for me. I’m just trying to soak it all in.”</p>



<p>An economics concentrator with the global health and health policy secondary and on the pre-med track, her junior year classes were intense. “I’ve been building skills throughout my almost four years here, so it has made me capable. I’m a more confident person.” For her senior thesis on healthcare, Bhathena is writing “about non-communicable diseases, specifically diabetes, because of the huge epidemic that America is currently dealing with, which is predicted to get worse.”</p>



<p>She continues to work as a section leader for EC 10, an introductory economics course. “It was a little daunting at first,” she said, “I have learned that I am capable of teaching concepts and connecting with students, and I found a lot of meaning through that role.”</p>



<p>As a first-year, Bhenthena shared, “Building relationships is the most important thing to me. I believe it is important to have empathy and show love for others,” and as she rounds out her senior year, that hasn’t changed. “I am a very loving person, but that’s because I’ve been lucky enough to be loved so much by my family, by my friends in College and out of College. I chose that one [word] as the last one, because I think it’s my favorite quality of mine, that I am lucky to have so many people that love me.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>“I just wanted to say something,” Reese Witherspoon said as she took her seat on stage at the Business School’s Klarman Hall. “It’s taken me 25 years, but this is my first day at Harvard!”</p>



<p>Those in attendance at the fireside chat, hosted by the Business School’s Women Student’s Association, were treated to a discussion of Witherspoon’s journey as an actor, producer, and entrepreneur. In a conversation that lasted about an hour, Witherspoon discussed how she grew her media company, Hello Sunshine, into a powerful creator of women-centered movies and television in Hollywood — and one whose partial sale earned Witherspoon $900 million.</p>



<p>Witherspoon also gamely recited some of Elle Woods’ most iconic Harvard-related lines from the classic “Legally Blonde” for the pink-hued attendees. “What, like it’s hard?” she said, to a roar from the crowd.</p>



<p>When asked about the throughline across her career, Witherspoon, 49, said that she’s always been a storyteller. “From the time I was 6 or 7 years old, I’d get all the kids on the playground to all act in a story I wanted to tell,” she said. This corralling also required leadership. “I was really good at persuading people to do things they didn’t want to do, and then working toward a common story.”</p>



<p>At the beginning of her career, Witherspoon fought for roles. Facing doubts from leaders at MGM Studios that she was right for the part of Elle Woods after multiple auditions, Witherspoon was asked to visit the MGM building and stay in character the entire time. Getting the part was exciting — and she continues to find inspiration and joy from the character decades later — but as her career continued, she felt underwhelmed by the lack of dynamic roles available to women in Hollywood.</p>



<p>Witherspoon’s solution was to “break systems.” She encouraged those in attendance to think about where they are situated in different systems within their own lives — their work, families, education, friend groups. “I think it’s important to say, ‘Do you feel comfortable where you sit in these systems?’” she asked. “And could you be the one to address the bigger issue?”</p>



<p>When she was 34, Witherspoon said, she worried that if she didn’t tackle the problem of lackluster representation of women’s stories then, she wasn’t going to leave the business any better off than she found it. “And the truth is, I have a daughter,” Witherspoon said. “I wanted to do it for her, because she deserves better storytelling, and her friends deserve better storytelling.”</p>

<p>To help remedy that, Witherspoon started a production company, Pacific Standard, which bought books and turned them into movies. The first three purchases were “Gone Girl,” “Wild,” and “Big Little Lies,” all of which became hits — earning three Oscar nominations and eight Emmy wins.</p>



<p>Witherspoon felt on top of the world until she got a call from her accountant. “She goes, ‘You’re breaking even. And I’m not sure you’re going to make payroll unless you go into your own personal finances to pay people,’” Witherspoon recalled. “I was just like, how is that possible? I could not be doing better, picking better winners, getting better budgets.” The trouble, she realized, was that she had the wrong business idea — making money off fees instead of having greater equity in the product.</p>



<p>After she complained about the situation to her friend Seth Rodsky, co-founder of the private equity firm Strand Partners, he said that to create a bigger company with more employees and more impact she should start over and shift the business plan. The transition to a model that emphasized equity, as well as a willingness to work with streaming platforms, pushed her new company into profitability and success.</p>



<p>In 2017, Hello Sunshine became the first company to sell a scripted television show to the new streaming platform Apple TV+. The unwillingness of other studios to do the same, Witherspoon said, helped Hello Sunshine negotiate an equity stake in each piece of content she created for Apple. “They didn’t like it,” she said. “It was precedent-breaking.” But the next time she negotiated, she was able to ask for the same favorable terms. The success accumulated. In 2021, Witherspoon sold a partial stake in the company to Candle Media, a company backed by the investment firm Blackstone, for nearly $1 billion.</p>



<p>The sale, Witherspoon said, helped the company continue to expand past scripted television shows and movies to events, branded social-media content, and Reese’s Book Club — all of which highlight women-centered stories.</p>



<p>Asked about her experience as an early adopter of new technologies and the potential of artificial intelligence, Witherspoon reflected on the opportunities she seized by embracing social media and streaming before other industry leaders. “You can’t fear the future,” Witherspoon said. “You have to jump in and jump in in a messy way.”</p>



<p>When it comes to adopting technologies like AI, perfection is impossible. “There are a lot of perfectionists in this room,” Witherspoon said. “You have to be perfect to get here. You don’t have to be perfect to get out of here.”</p>



<p>The crowd’s enthusiasm was on display during the Q&amp;A session. Among the top questions: “Does your company have summer internships?”</p>



<p>Witherspoon smiled. “It does!”</p>

			Economists, experts face off over nation’s experiences with both since post-World War II era		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Would Americans be better off if the nation shifted from its post-World War II free-trade approach to one that favors higher tariffs?</p>



<p>That was the question posed to those attending an Institute for Business in Global Society debate on Wednesday evening, hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments in a highly anticipated case challenging the global tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>



<p>For the audience’s part, 30 percent favored a change while 70 percent did not. The debaters were, by design, more evenly split.</p>



<p>Arguing for “yes” were Oren Cass, founder of the think tank American Compass and author of “The New Conservatives,” and Katherine Tai, J.D. ’01, a lawyer, former U.S. trade representative under President Joe Biden, and currently a fellow at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>



<p>Taking the opposing side were Robert Lawrence, the Albert L. Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at the Kennedy School, and Lawrence Summers, the Charles W. Eliot University Professor, former University president, and former U.S. treasury secretary.</p>



<p>Much of the discussion centered on issues of balance and fairness.</p>



<p>Cass called the current system “very imbalanced” and “not best for prosperity.”</p>



<p>Lawrence later pointed out that perfect economic balance is only achieved in a barter economy, where one good is directly traded for another. He concluded: “Nothing is going to guarantee balance.”</p>



<p>Cass went on to argue that the premise that free trade always promotes prosperity is “essentially wrong” and dismissed the idea that trade imbalances are self-correcting. Stressing that some kind of intervention is needed, he said “strategic tariffs are going to be higher tariffs.”</p>



<p>Summers, in response, focused on the unequal impact of tariffs. Pointing out that people with less money are more likely to spend on goods, while those with more spend on services, he argued that tariffs function as a regressive tax, forcing the poor to spend more while the rich reap the benefits.</p>



<p>“Using tariffs as a way to try to correct trade imbalances is using the wrong instrument,” he said.</p>



<p>Speaking as a onetime history major, Tai sought to put the debate in context.</p>



<p>After World War II, she said, the U.S. went from a highly regulated New Deal-influenced economy, which lasted several decades, to a neo-liberal Reagan-era world of free-trade agreements, where the perception is “government is part of the problem.”</p>



<p>Making the case for tariffs, she pointed out that the current free-trade era has seen two major economic crises — one sparked by the subprime mortgages collapse in 2008-2009 and the other, in 2020-2021, by the pandemic supply-chain breakdown.</p>



<p>“Do you feel like the promise of the neoliberal era … is delivering the results it’s supposed to?” she asked.</p>



<p>The opposition was quick to counter claims of damage brought by tariffs.</p>



<p>Bringing up levies on imported steel in response, Summers noted that&nbsp;tariffs may help U.S. steelworkers by making imports more expensive, but it will hurt those employed by companies that make products with steel — and there are far more of them.</p>



<p>Instead, he argued that trade with allies and “good mercantilism” should be goals.</p>



<p>However, Summers’ pivot to discussing trade agreements as a means of cementing alliances triggered a conversation on the case of China.</p>



<p>Cass recalled how China was brought into the World Trade Organization in 2001 — a move <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/09/china-wto-20-years-524050">some analysts</a> say helped it become a trading powerhouse, in part due to unfair practices, and resulted in a loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>



<p>Cass argued that using tariffs now to confront the global giant is “the only rational perspective.”</p>



<p>Speaking specifically of the auto industry, and China’s place atop the electric vehicle market, he said: “There are only two options — allow China to dominate or confront them.”</p>



<p>At stake are real lives, Tai stressed. Acknowledging that she feels uneasy in today’s economy, she cast the problem as widespread.</p>



<p>“When we’re talking about an economy, we’re talking about the people in the economy,” she said. “Consumers spending money at the market are workers, who have to have a job, who have to get paid a wage, who have the right to advocate for themselves and bargain in the marketplace of the workplace to better those wages.”</p>



<p>With free trade, she concluded, “productivity has gone up, but wages have not kept pace.”</p>



<p>The debate turned to how tariffs are currently used. Cass acknowledged the apparent contradiction of raising levies on allies such as Canada, but argued that such moves are simply “a bargaining tool.”</p>



<p>But Lawrence said tariffs are actually ineffectual as policy tools.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“If you want more jobs, it’s more efficient to subsidize production,” he said. “If you want to raise revenue, it’s more efficient to have a broadly based sale tax than to use a tariff.”</p>



<p>Considering what could replace the current system, Tai drew on her experience in the Biden administration to point out how both Biden and Trump saw a use for tariffs. The differences in their approaches are so great, however, that they have colored discussion about the utility of tariffs as part of the nation’s foreign policy.</p>



<p>At the end of the evening, a final vote on the proposal showed at least a few minds had been changed, with a final count of 32 percent in favor and 68 percent opposed.</p>

			‘Genuinely Hard Problems’ pilots novel approach to scientific education		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>A few weeks after their arrival at the College, 15 first-year students settled into chairs for an unusual class — one with no answers.</p>



<p>The brainchild of Dean of Science Jeff Lichtman, “Genuinely Hard Problems in Science” explores mysteries of the natural world that have stubbornly resisted the best efforts to crack them. How did life emerge from non-biological matter? How did single cells evolve into complex life? What mechanisms drive the aging process — and can they be reversed? What is the relationship between brain anatomy and mental illness?</p>



<p>In this class, there is no assumption that scientific authorities are right. Rather than training conformists who follow their elders down well-worn routes — and possibly to dead ends — the instructors want out-of-the-box thinkers who can blaze new pathways.</p>



<p>“What we’re trying to do,” explained <a href="https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/people/jeff-lichtman">Lichtman</a>, “is transform science, 15 students at a time.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote has-purple-color is-style-sand" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);--primary-page-color-bright:var(--color-purple-bright);--primary-page-color-text:var(--color-purple-dark);--primary-page-color-ui:var(--color-purple);--primary-page-color-reverse-background:var(--color-purple);--primary-page-color-reverse-text:var(--color-white);--primary-page-color-reverse-ui:var(--color-white)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;What we’re trying to do is transform science, 15 students at a time.&#8221;</p><cite>Jeff Lichtman</cite></blockquote></div>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-narrative-for-undergraduate-education">‘A new narrative for undergraduate education’</h5>



<p>“Genuinely Hard Problems,” or GHP as it’s become known in the division, seeks to pilot a new approach to a scientific landscape that has been reshaped by technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional scientific education is designed to develop expertise in one discipline. But today anybody with a smartphone can instantly retrieve vast amounts of scientific information. Artificial Intelligence performs some tasks with speed and accuracy no human can match.</p>



<p>“Depth of expertise and knowledge in the traditional sense are far less valuable perhaps than they once were,” said <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/mccarty">Logan McCarty</a>, associate dean of science education, who is co-teaching the class with Lichtman. “If you need to learn a specific task or a specific concept, you now can turn to ChatGPT.”</p>



<p>Indoctrination within one narrow discipline can confine a scientist, McCarty noted — and lead them into blind alleys from which they cannot escape. Indeed, the historian of science and philosopher Thomas Kuhn ’43, Ph.D. ’49, famously described scientific training as “a narrow and rigid education, probably more so than any other except perhaps in orthodox theology.”</p>



<p>“If you spend a 10-year career learning a specific skill and a specific task and becoming an expert in something, you tend to not want to jettison all of that knowledge and training,” said McCarty, a chemist who also teaches physics and applied math. “That’s where the dogma can actually trap you inside a particular way of thinking.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="683" width="1024" src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Jeff Lichtman (left) with Logan McCarty." class="wp-image-419563" srcset="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg 1680w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=48,32 48w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=96,64 96w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425_Seminar_335.jpeg?resize=1488,993 1488w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jeff Lichtman (left) with Logan McCarty.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The seminar’s solution: catching first-years before their minds become shaped by orthodoxy. Lichtman and McCarty hope to instill students with a multidisciplinary, expansive outlook — thus emboldening them to peer over the walls of any maze.</p>



<p>“This class is sort of the tip of the iceberg of what we hope is a big reimagining of undergraduate science education,” said McCarty. “In some ways, this is about creating a new narrative for undergraduate education in the sciences. These students are our first cohort.”</p>



<p>About 160 incoming students applied for spots in the seminar. Fifteen were selected for the fall cohort, and another 15 will take it in the spring. Next year, Lichtman and McCarty will offer the class again and add sophomore programming, allowing current students to continue their journeys, possibly with advisers.</p>



<p>Genuinely Hard Problems are challenges that have stumped scientists despite decades of research. Solving them is not simply a matter of continuing to hammer away with current approaches. Instead, solutions require conceptual breakthroughs.</p>



<p>“It’s a very strange education because you’re not teaching kids facts,” Lichtman said. “You’re teaching them things that are not known. There is no textbook about the unanswered questions in science.”</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-to-attack-problems">Learning to attack problems</h5>



<p>Each week, GHP invites guest lecturers to class — Harvard faculty who conduct research into unsolved problems. Michael Segel, assistant professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, outlined the mysteries of why we age. Dan Freed, Shiing-Shen Chern Professor of Mathematics, presented the Millennium Prize Problems, a series of unsolved mathematical challenges. Dimitar Sasselov, Phillips Professor of Astronomy, and Adam Cohen, professor of chemistry, chemical biology and physics, presented the enigma of the origins of life on Earth. At the end of the semester, each student will pick a hard problem to study, possibly for the remainder of their undergraduate years, and instructors will match them with a mentor.</p>



<p>The course description intrigued Adam Stone, a first-year from Charlotte, North Carolina. “I thought that this class was really exciting for couple of reasons,” he said. “One is that you get a taste of all these different fields — biology, physics, math. I think the idea of trying to tackle something that no one knows the answer to is really exciting.”</p>

<p>Stone also was driven by personal motivation: He has Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes sudden, involuntarily movements. Like many other brain conditions, it remains poorly understood. “If you understand the framework of how to tackle these unsolved problems, you can apply that to so many things that that can really make a difference in people’s lives,” he said.</p>



<p>Likewise, Belén Franco de la Matta, from Northvale, New Jersey, was drawn by the opportunity to survey a broad array of sciences and work closely with a mentor. “Personally, I’m very interested in physics and mathematics, but at the same time, there’s so many valuable things that we can learn from other topics, such as biology or computer science,” she said. “In class, we’ve been talking about how in order to solve difficult problems, sometimes you can tackle them with the ways of thinking from other fields.”</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-black-holes-and-black-boxes">Black holes and black boxes</h5>



<p>In late September, <a href="https://galison.scholars.harvard.edu/">Peter Galison</a>, Joseph Pellegrino&nbsp;University Professor of History of Science and of Physics, gave the students a primer on his <a href="https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/">research into black holes</a>. The discussion explored theoretical questions of how science balances prediction, explanation, and understanding.</p>



<p>“You said, in the beginning of your lecture, that the majority of things in science are a black box,” said Lucille Nomaguchi-Long ’29. “Do you think we’ll ever get to a point where we will be able to uncover all those black boxes, or even, fully understand one black box?”</p>



<p>We can go a long way toward understanding natural phenomena, answered Galison, but we also must resign ourselves that much will remain beyond our comprehension. “There’s almost no branch of science, none, that we can understand completely,” he said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote has-purple-color is-style-sand" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);--primary-page-color-bright:var(--color-purple-bright);--primary-page-color-text:var(--color-purple-dark);--primary-page-color-ui:var(--color-purple);--primary-page-color-reverse-background:var(--color-purple);--primary-page-color-reverse-text:var(--color-white);--primary-page-color-reverse-ui:var(--color-white)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;There’s almost no branch of science, none, that we can understand completely.&#8221;</p><cite>Peter Galison</cite></blockquote></div>



<p>Then Lichtman interjected another perspective: Often our understanding is just a “gloss” — a superficial explanation that distracts us from the more important goal of making accurate predictions.</p>



<p>“The ego of a person cares more about understanding than prediction,” said Lichtman, Jeremy R. Knowles Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology. “But to make the world work, all that matters, I would argue, is prediction.”</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-joy-in-the-questions">Finding joy in the questions</h5>



<p>A week later, the class took on yet another unsolved problem: How does genetic code translate into biology?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/mansi-srivastava">Mansi Srivastava</a>, co-chair of the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, gave the lecture, recounting how a burst of optimism swept through her field when the first genomes were sequenced in the early years of the new millennium. People imagined the genome as a “blueprint” — a plan that could easily be translated into physiology and behavior. Those hopes were dashed when it became clear that the matter was far more complex. “We thought we would be able to solve it 25 years ago,” she said, “and we have been deeply humbled.”</p>



<p>Today, entire genomes can be sequenced, and scientists are beginning to decipher how the expression of genes can be modified by epigenetic effects during the lifetime of the organism. Despite those advances, we remain unable to fully translate genotype into phenotype. “Maybe this idea of a blueprint being some perfect instruction was never true,” Srivastava said. “Maybe we carried the analogy too far in thinking about genetics and development.”</p>



<p>Standing beside the projection screen, the professor posed a question to the class.</p>



<p>“Say I give you all the information — I can tell you how the environment impacts things, I can tell you all the epigenetic marks. Do you think even then we’d be able to predict the phenotype? Or is it hopeless?”</p>



<p>“Maybe some of it, yeah,” answered Rosa Kooijmans. “Not all of it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I like your light of hope,” responded Srivastava. “Because if you don’t have hope, then we might as well go home.”</p>



<p>Her advice to students: Spend time thinking carefully about how to define your questions of interest. The road will be long, so learn to find joy in the questions.</p>



<p>“You find your path, because that’s the big task that I want you to solve in the next four years,” said Srivastava. “Or maybe in the next 30 years of your careers.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>At Harvard Art Museums, paintings by renowned artists such as Pablo Picasso, John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, Piet Mondrian, and Georges Seurat capture viewers’ attention with their rich colors and practiced brush strokes. A fall exhibition strips down the styles that made these artists, and others, famous to expose raw expression and experimentation in the most basic form of composition — drawing.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/6465/sketch-shade-smudge-drawing-from-gray-to-black">Sketch, Shade, Smudge: Drawing from Gray to Black</a>” showcases around 120 works spanning the 19th to 21st centuries all done in a combination of drawing mediums — chalk, charcoal, graphite, and crayon.</p>



<p>“It’s a love letter to drawing,” said <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/66">Penley Knipe</a>, the Philip and Lynn Straus Senior Conservator of Works of Art on Paper. “We have an amazing drawing collection here. It’s one of the best in the country, maybe in the world.”</p>



<p>The exhibition was curated by Knipe, as well as Division of European and American Art curator <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/32">Miriam Stewart</a>. The pair spent over a year carefully choosing works that would not only show off the museums’ collection of rarely seen works but also demonstrate the versatility of simple tools in the hands of artists.</p>



<p>“Some of our favorite drawings are up in this exhibition,” Knipe said during a recent tour of the gallery. She pointed to a large Degas charcoal drawing last brought out for exhibition in <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2005/04/all-his-pretty-ones/">2005</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="419295" src="https://i0.wp.com/news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102325_Sketch_Shade_Smudge_0031.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" class="image-compare__image-before"/><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="419296" src="https://i0.wp.com/news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102325_Sketch_Shade_Smudge_0032.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" class="image-compare__image-after"/></div><figcaption>&#8220;After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself&#8221; by Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“This drawing by Degas was in perilous condition and lived up in the conservation lab for decades because it’s on tracing paper, which is super thin, and it was then adhered to a thicker board,” Knipe noted. “It needed to come off because it was starting to fracture.”</p>



<p>All the materials in the exhibition, including the charcoal drawings, are fragile. As a conservator, Knipe played a key role in making sure the works on view were viable to be framed and hung. This process, she said, lent itself to better understanding the works — what makes them unique and what makes them alike. She noted charcoal’s ability to be “intensely rich and velvety, or delicately gray and suggestive” while graphite — the material in pencils — is “slippery, shiny, and easy to erase.” Crayon, Knipe said, “is deeply black and waxy, whereas chalk can be crumbly and diffuse.”</p>

<p>In addition to exploring artists’ materials, “Sketch, Shade, Smudge,”as the name implies, also explores the manipulation of those materials and how artists use them, alter them, and play with them.</p>



<p>The exhibition shows how pressure applied to graphite can bring out its shimmery effect, and scraping away waxy layers of crayon can reveal stark highlights. Beyond the works hanging in the gallery, Knipe and Stewart also tried their hand at some of the altering techniques themselves — recording their attempts. Links to those videos can be found throughout the exhibition, and on the Harvard Art Museums’ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harvardartmuseums/?hl=en">Instagram account</a>.</p>



<p>For erasing a lighter material like charcoal, graphite, or chalk, Knipe said they found that the historical way to do it — with bread — is actually most effective. “So you take a loaf of French bread, you go into the middle, and you kind of roll it into a stump shape.”</p>



<p>For those wanting to try their hand at some of the techniques seen in the latter half of the exhibition, staff have set up an area with stools, paper, and pencils.</p>



<p>“It’s set up as a 19th-century academic drawing academy where you would come and you would draw from the nude. You would draw from other arts. You would draw from sculpture. You would draw still lives — skulls and feet, plaster casts and things,” Knipe said. “And so one of the things that we hope is that people come, they see all of the drawings, and they realize, ‘I kind of want to try my hand at this.’”</p>



<p>She also noted that it’s best not to bring any bread into the gallery, and instead opt for the rubber erasers provided.</p>



<p><em>“Sketch, Shade, Smudge: Drawing from Gray to Black” is on display in the Special Exhibitions Gallery through Jan. 18. The Harvard Art Museums are free to all and open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.</em></p>

			Fajr Khan to represent Pakistan, plans career in clinical psychology		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Fajr Khan has learned the value of small things — giving somebody a meal, providing a safe place to sleep, or being fully engaged during a conversation with a lonely person.</p>



<p>Most her volunteer work with homeless people has been done quietly. But now the senior is trying to grasp a very different experience that is not so anonymous: winning a Rhodes Scholarship.</p>



<p>“It still hasn’t really settled in,” Khan said with a laugh. “It just feels very not real. There’s like this level of disbelief. But it’s very cool and exciting.”</p>



<p>Khan was chosen as one of two Rhodes Scholars representing Pakistan. She will spend two years at Oxford University, where she hopes to complete a master’s degree in clinical neuroscience, psychology, or psychiatry.</p>



<p>Afterward, she hopes to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and a career that combines research and working with patients.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of stigma around mental health and a lot of misconceptions,” she said. “A lot of people consider it a rich man’s disease, but the data shows that people in vulnerable situations in poverty are some of the people with the most debilitating conditions and the ones who need mental health care. The fact that this Rhodes committee from Pakistan showed this commitment to taking mental health seriously is absolutely amazing — and very encouraging.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24)"><blockquote><p>“I think the biggest way that you can make an immediate, direct impact is through human connection, with human empathy.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Khan calls herself a “classic international kid.” Born in Pakistan, she moved to Amsterdam as a toddler so her mother could begin a Ph.D. program in economics. The family remained in the Netherlands while her mother and father worked in the energy sector.</p>



<p>She attended international schools and grew up speaking English, Urdu, and Dutch. When she was 16, the family moved back to Pakistan, and she enrolled in an international school in Lahore.</p>



<p>At Harvard, she is studying neuroscience with a secondary in philosophy — and many forays into other subjects, such the history of science, creative writing, lyric poetry, and global health.</p>



<p>“If you look at my transcript, you would not be able to tell what my concentration was until my third year,” she said with a chuckle. “Probably because I was very much one of those ‘explore everything!’ people.”</p>



<p>Khan is particularly interested in public health. In 2024, she did a summer internship with Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance in Geneva, Switzerland. Last January, she started working as a research assistant at a clinic for mothers with postpartum traumatic stress disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>



<p>She has been active in the Phillips Brooks House Association and volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, a student-run operation in the basement of&nbsp;University Lutheran Church. She has served meals, cleaned bathrooms, and worked directly with clients alongside a case manager.</p>



<p>Later she became a supervisor for overnight shifts. Now she serves as the shelter’s policy director.</p>



<p>“A lot of the time, issues can feel so big and all-encompassing, and it can be difficult trying to figure out where to start,” she said. “I think the biggest way that you can make an immediate, direct impact is through human connection, with human empathy. I’ve grown up in so many different places — different languages, different cultures — and one-on-one, human connection is something that I remember the most.”</p>



<p>When Khan made the shortlist of Rhodes finalists, she flew home to Pakistan for two days of social events and interviews.</p>



<p>On the final day, the candidates were called into interviews, one by one. The selection committee deliberated briefly and emerged to announce the two winners. Typically, at least one — and sometimes both — attend universities in Pakistan, so Khan figured the odds were not in her favor.</p>



<p>“They came out with a piece of paper, and they called my name,” she said. “I was just in complete disbelief. I remember I got up from my chair, but then I was like, ‘Wait, I don’t even know why I’m standing!’”</p>



<p>Khan phoned her parents and told them she was done and ready to be picked up — but nothing about winning.</p>



<p>Her parents drove up in front of the grand house where the event was hosted.</p>



<p>“I came downstairs, opened the door, and sat in the car,” she recalled. “Then I said, ‘Guess who’s a Rhodes Scholar!’”</p>

<p>Ballet dancer Misty Copeland, WNBA star Brittney Griner, and filmmaker Shelton Jackson “Spike” Lee were among the honorees at this year’s W.E.B. Du Bois Medal ceremony. The event, organized annually by the <a href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/">Hutchins Center for African &amp; African American Research</a>, recognizes changemakers for their lasting contributions to Black culture, scholarship, and civic life.</p>



<p>Also presented with medals were South Carolina Rep. James E. Clyburn, artist Amy Sherald, and entrepreneur George E. Johnson, whose products revolutionized Black hair care in mid-century America. The politician and human rights activist Marielle Franco was honored posthumously. Franco, an elected member of Rio de Janeiro’s City Council who was assassinated in 2018, became the award’s first Brazilian recipient.</p>

<p>Honorees are said to follow in the footsteps of Du Bois, a towering scholar, author, and activist who became the first Black person to earn a Harvard Ph.D. in 1895. “Each of our seven esteemed medalists embodies this brilliant and courageous man’s dedication to excellence in the arts, in business, philanthropy, and public service — and his determination to fight racism and ethnic hatred wherever they raise their pernicious, ugly heads,” said <a href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/henry-louis-gates-jr">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a>, Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and director of the Hutchins Center.</p>



<p>Celebrating their contributions at Sanders Theatre was an enthusiastic crowd of family, friends, students, and community members. <a href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/glenn-h-hutchins">Glenn H. Hutchins</a>, the donor who also chairs the Hutchins Center’s National Advisory Board, shared that Copeland had met earlier with College students involved with the Harvard dance scene. Griner and Lee spent the afternoon with players from the women’s and men’s basketball teams.</p>



<p>“You are society’s future leaders, culture-shapers, and role models,” Hutchins said to the students in the audience. “We expect some of you will be on the stage in the future receiving one of these awards.”</p>



<p>Some of the ceremony’s most powerful moments called back to the medal’s namesake. Sherald, well-known for her <a href="https://npg.si.edu/learn/classroom-resource/michelle-obama">richly colored portrait</a> of former first lady Michelle Obama, was in graduate school when she discovered Du Bois’ <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/dubois.html">“Exhibit of American Negroes”</a> for the 1900 Paris Exhibition. The display, awarded its own medal by organizers of the World’s Fair, wielded photography and data visualization against racist stereotypes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I recognized something of myself in what he was doing — using images to affirm the beauty, intellect, and complexity of Black life,” Sherald recalled. “In that moment, I understood that the work that I was beginning to make — portraiture rooted in grace, in stillness, in the interior lives of Black people — was part of the same conversation.”</p>



<p>Copeland, the first Black dancer promoted to principal in American Ballet Theater’s 85-year history, also evoked the power of representation. Projected behind her was a photo of her confetti-filled final bow, taken just last month, following 25 years with the New York company.</p>



<p>“Standing in that space, I realized that representation isn’t only about being seen,” Copeland said. “It’s about what seeing makes possible. It’s about transforming a tradition, expanding who’s invited to the table, and keeping that door open wide enough for generations to follow.”</p>

<p>The event doubled as a showcase for the Harvard community’s talent and sense of unity. Hopi Hoekstra, Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, took the stage to share a chapter from Du Bois’ “The Souls of Black Folk” (1903). Brandon Terry, John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences, read from Du Bois’ 1909 text “John Brown.” Sarah Lewis, John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Humanities and Associate Professor of African and African American Studies, excerpted “The Criteria for Negro Art” (1926).</p>



<p>Retired WNBA player and former Crimson basketball <a href="https://gocrimson.com/news/2019/9/9/9_9_2019_12958">MVP</a> Allison Feaster ’98, currently a vice president with the Boston Celtics, got personal when presenting Griner with her medal. Feaster called the 6-foot-9, three-time Olympic gold medalist — whom she had never met before Tuesday — “one of my heroes” for building interest in the WNBA while embracing her role as an activist following a 10-month imprisonment in Russia three years ago.</p>



<p>“Your experience reminded us all: When one of us is in pain, none of us can remain silent,” Feaster said. “Through your partnership with <a href="https://www.bringourfamilieshome.org/">Bring Our Families Home</a>, you are fighting for others who are wrongly detained abroad, and we thank you for that.”</p>



<p>Other event highlights included Lee’s comical exhortations to fellow New York Knicks fans and Clyburn’s one-by-one acknowledgments of longtime staffers and loved ones. Johnson, who launched Johnson Products Co. in 1954, is known for elevating joyful pictures of Black America through his 1970s sponsorship of the hit TV show “Soul Train.” His remarks shined brightest concerning his impact as an employer, offering Chicagoans well-paying jobs and benefits.</p>



<p>“As I look back on my life at 98 years old,” he said, to a burst of applause, “I am grateful.”</p>

<p>When a decision by federal agencies or officials is challenged in court, judges implicitly trust that the government is operating in good faith when it explains how and why it made the decision. It’s a tradition of deference known as the presumption of regularity.</p>



<p>Since January, however, a growing number of federal judges have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-hear-arguments-trump-deportation-flights-defied-court/story?id=120446845">sharply criticized</a> Trump administration attorneys over their conduct and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/02/nx-s1-5385355/perkins-coie-trump-executive-order-law-firms">questioned</a> their truthfulness in several high-profile <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-allow-illinois-troop-deployment-2025-10-17/">immigration enforcement</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/27/pam-bondi-kristi-noem-comments-kilmar-abrego-garcia-00624342">deportation</a> cases, as well as others involving law firms and federal workers. Most recently, a judge in Virginia <a href="https://apnews.com/article/comey-justice-department-trump-a342c81a84c72917a33e6627afa0b35f">raised concerns</a> about the actions of federal prosecutors in the James Comey case.</p>



<p><a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/andrew-mergen/">Andrew Mergen</a> spent three decades as an attorney at the Department of Justice and is now a visiting assistant clinical professor of law and faculty director of the Emmett Environmental Law &amp; Policy Clinic at <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a>. In this edited conversation, he explains why losing the court’s confidence could significantly harm the DOJ.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-narrow-single-line"/>



<p><strong>Where does this presumption of regularity come from?</strong></p>



<p>There’s a common-sense notion that we assume that people in our day-to-day lives are doing what they are supposed to do. And in the government, the idea is that we should assume that government people are discharging their duties in an upright and forthright and legal way. Historically, the presumption began as a way of filling in evidentiary gaps, and it applied to both private officials and to corporate officers. The common example is, if a document was filed from a corporation with a corporate seal on it, we assume that it was filed by a person authorized to submit that document. You could call it a deference doctrine, or you could call it a working principle. We assume that people have discharged their official duties in a forthright, honest way, and what that principle means is that the courts will insist on some meaningful evidentiary showing before entertaining doubts about official acts or documents.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-d40dffb7-ff7a-4e26-b736-6cdd0079e14c">
<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote is-style-colored"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The majority of career civil servants are forthright, candid, honest people. They’re trying to do the best for the American people.”</p></blockquote></div>
</div>



<p><strong>Why do the courts offer it to the government?</strong></p>



<p>Because it makes the government more efficient overall. Mostly what we’re talking about are public law disputes. For example, you might challenge a government decision to award a permit or start a ground-disturbing activity. That decision is typically reviewed on the basis of an administrative record that the government submits to the court. So, if the government says we’re going to build this rocket base, and we’ve looked at all the environmental harms and concluded that this is the best way to do this in a way that complies with environmental statutes, and here’s the record that we submit, no one asks: “Is this really the record?” The presumption is that the record is what the government says it is. To be sure, a person could argue that the record is incomplete, but the presumption requires the challenger to make some showing that the record is incomplete before a court will consider the challenge. This makes government more efficient. The presumption of regularity avoids us getting courts tied up in a lot of minutiae. The government says that the record was submitted and the person in charge of putting that together did all the right things and that is the end of the story.</p>



<p><strong>How unusual is it to see judges openly express skepticism about the government’s intentions and veracity?</strong></p>



<p>There’s a presumption of regularity and then there’s also the special duty that governmental lawyers have as officers of the court. I spent 33 years as a Justice Department attorney. I was in court a lot and I understood that every time I stood before a federal judge I had a responsibility as a member of the bar — all lawyers have that — and then I had a special obligation as a member of the federal government. I knew that I had to be candid. I knew that I had a special obligation to be truthful. I owed the court a real explanation of why the government was doing something different or had changed its mind that the judge was rightfully entitled to probe.</p>



<p>Part of what we’re seeing in, for example, the Kilmar Abrego Garcia situation is a real doubt about whether the government is being truthful or hiding the ball. That’s a little bit different from a presumption of regularity. It’s in the same family, but also a bigger problem. If the judge doesn’t believe you, if a judge thinks you’re lying to them or concealing something, you are in a really, really bad place. Historically, the Justice Department has had a very good reputation for credibility, for forthrightness. Any time you talked to a judge or a clerk in the federal court system, someone would invariably say, “I read the government’s brief first because I expect the government’s brief to not be full of hyperbole and to tell the truth.” You’re obligated to zealously represent your client, but Justice Department attorneys have historically tempered that zealousness with their special responsibility for candor and credibility to the courts.</p>



<p><strong>What danger does this doubt voiced by judges pose in the future?</strong></p>



<p>What’s terrifying about this moment is that it will carry over. One of the things that’s really damaging about the way that the administration is treating the courts is that it is going to hurt the credibility of the Justice Department overall. Most cases in federal courts that the Justice Department defends are not things like extraterritorial extradition. They’re boring. And what we worry about is judges saying, “Can I trust the Justice Department in boring cases?” That is going to harm the government overall. </p>

			Study finds larger, deeper brain bleeds at an earlier age for patients who have 3 or more alcoholic drinks a day		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>A new study by investigators from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/">Mass General Brigham</a>&nbsp;suggests that heavy alcohol use may lead to more severe brain bleeds and cause long-term brain vessel damage at a younger age. The team’s results, based on patients treated for brain bleeds at Massachusetts General Hospital, are published online in&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neurology</a><em>,</em>&nbsp;the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.</p>



<p>“The brain bleed is one of the most lethal and disabling conditions known to human beings,” said corresponding author&nbsp;<a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3296317/Edip-Gurol">Edip Gurol</a>, a clinician investigator in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology and associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. “They come on suddenly, cause severe damage, and often leave patients with life-changing disabilities. It’s one of the most difficult conditions to recover from.”</p>



<p>A brain bleed — also called an intracerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke — happens when a blood vessel inside the brain bursts. Up to 50 percent of people with this condition die, and 30 percent are severely disabled. Only 20 percent of people who sustain a brain bleed can take care of themselves independently a full year later, Gurol said.</p>



<p>The study used a cohort of 1,600 patients admitted between 2003 and 2019 to Massachusetts General Hospital who had a brain bleed that was not a result of an injury or trauma. They used CT scans to assess the size and location of the brain bleed. They checked MRI scans for signs of damage to the brain’s small blood vessels.</p>



<p>About 7 percent of the brain-bleed patients reported consuming three or more drinks a day. Compared with those who didn’t drink, the people who drank heavily were younger when the brain bleed happened (average age 64 versus 75) and had bleeds that were about 70 percent bigger. They were twice as likely to have a bleed deep inside the brain or one that spread into the brain’s fluid-filled spaces. The researchers saw that an even lower level of alcohol intake, two drinks per day, was significantly associated with younger age of onset of a brain bleed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24)"><blockquote><p>The researchers hypothesize that heavy alcohol use raises blood pressure, damaging the small blood vessels in the brain, making them weak and more likely to leak or burst.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>People who drank heavily had lower platelet counts (cell fragments that help blood clot) and higher blood pressure when they arrived at the hospital. They were more likely to show evidence of damage in the tiny blood vessels in the brain, which is linked to dementia, memory loss, and walking problems. It’s also a major risk factor for a brain bleed.</p>



<p>The researchers hypothesize that heavy alcohol use raises blood pressure, damaging the small blood vessels in the brain, making them weak and more likely to leak or burst. On top of that, lowered platelet counts make it harder for the body to stop bleeding. Together, these factors greatly increase the risk of a brain bleed.</p>



<p>Drinking less is a key part of stroke and brain health prevention efforts, the researchers said.</p>



<p>“We now know that heavy drinking leads to larger, earlier brain bleeds,” said Gurol. “Minimizing or stopping alcohol use is an important step to lower that risk. Even for people at relatively low brain-bleeding risk, limiting alcohol consumption to no more than three drinks per week may be an effective measure to protect against all types of stroke and to preserve both brain and cardiovascular health.”</p>



<p>This study has some limitations. Alcohol use was self-reported, the number of people who drank heavily was small, it took place at a single hospital, and the cohort investigated was mostly white patients. It also captured only one point in time, so it cannot show cause and effect. Future research with larger, more diverse groups should explore how different levels of alcohol use affect small vessel disease, brain aging, and the risk of blockage-type strokes.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>In 1873, Charles Eliot Norton wrote a letter to his cousin, Harvard President Charles William Eliot, to propose what was then a bold idea: add art history courses to the University’s curriculum.</p>



<p>Education, Norton argued, is incomplete without the study of the fine arts. Norton, who had just returned from five years in Europe, had become inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement after hearing art historian John Ruskin lecture at Oxford and conversing with his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson on the boat back to Boston.</p>



<p>“Architecture, sculpture, and painting have been, next to literature, the most important modes of expression of the sentiments, beliefs and opinions of men,” Norton wrote. “They afford evidence, often in a more striking and direct manner than literature itself, of the moral temper and intellectual culture of the various races by whom they have been practiced and thus become the most effective aids to the proper understanding of history.”</p>



<p>His argument was convincing. Thus began Harvard’s <a href="https://haa.fas.harvard.edu/">Department of History of Art and Architecture</a> (originally called the Fine Arts Department), making Harvard the first U.S. university to develop a professorship and a permanent program for art history curriculum. This year the department will mark its 150th anniversary with a conference slated for Nov. 7-8 called “<a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/haa150">The Education of the Eyes: 150 Years of Art History at Harvard</a>.”</p>



<p>Co-hosted by the <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/">Harvard Art Museums</a>, the conference will bring together academics, art critics, and curators from across the U.S. and Europe to reflect on the history and legacy of the department, and on the future of the art history field. <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/haa150/conference-program/">Speakers</a> include former Museum of Modern Art Director Glenn Lowry, art critic Rosalind Krauss, art historian Svetlana Alpers, and New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman.</p>

<p>“I’m so thrilled and happy about the conference that is going to happen,” said <a href="https://haa.fas.harvard.edu/people/felipe-pereda">Felipe Pereda</a>, Fernando Zóbel de Ayala Professor of Spanish Art and director of graduate studies for the department. “For the graduate students, it presents what the future could be and gives them the opportunity to think about how they can shape where the department is moving to, and where art history is moving to, at a moment in which the visual has more importance than ever in the production of culture.”</p>



<p>The conference will include presentations on topics ranging from the relationship between artist and critic, to art that is included versus excluded in the discipline. Pereda, who has been the driving force behind planning the conference, conducted extensive research to piece together the department’s origin story, with documents found in the archives at the Harvard Art Museums, Houghton Library, the University Archives, and University of London’s Warburg Institute.</p>



<p>The event’s title comes from an idea central to an early ethos of Harvard’s Fine Arts Department: the German concept of Augenerziehung, which translates to “education of the eye.”</p>



<p>“The idea that developed was that to be educated wasn’t only going to be in the realm of reading books and reasoning from them. There was something different and deeply salient about grappling with artifacts, with humanly made things,” explained <a href="https://haa.fas.harvard.edu/people/joseph-koerner">Joseph Koerner</a>, chair of the department and Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture.</p>

</div></div></div></section>



<p>From the start, the new department was designed to combine intellectual inquiry with practical training. The first two fine arts courses offered, in the 1874-75 school year, were “The History of the Fine Arts and Their Relation to Literature,” taught by Norton, and “Principles of Design,” a studio course taught by painter <a href="https://harvardartmuseums.org/article/the-beginnings-of-art-history-at-harvard-part-2-charles-herbert-moore-john-ruskin-and-the-teaching-of-drawing">Charles Herbert Moore</a>, in which students learned to draw.</p>



<p>“The program initiated students in the practice of drawing — not to become artists, but to understand artists’ creative process. In other words, to educate their eyes,” Pereda said.</p>



<p>This commitment to studying real objects led the University to begin collecting art. In 1895, Harvard founded the Fogg Museum of Art, making its Art History Department the first in the nation to have its own museum. Housed with the Fine Arts Department in Hunt Hall, which was located where Canaday Hall is today, the museum served as a “laboratory for the eye,” where classes often gathered to examine paintings up close.</p>



<p>“It was a laboratory,” Koerner said. “There were instruments, and people studied how paints were made, how lacquer is produced, how bronze was cast. Science and art history, they’re not that different, both are ways of understanding how things came about, how facts are produced.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--24)"><blockquote><p>“It was not just about learning the difference between a Rembrandt and one of his followers, or about appreciating beautiful things.”</p><cite>Joseph Koerner, department chair</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Over time, the emphasis on practicing artmaking dwindled as the field became more “bookish,” Koerner said. The art history department stopped offering drawing courses in the 1960s. By the time Koerner was completing his graduate work and beginning to teach in the 1980s, it was “inconceivable” that a scholar might try learning skills like etching, engraving, or ink-making as part of the research process, he recalled.</p>



<p>But now, those ideas are coming back around.</p>



<p>“Fast-forward to today, the thoughts of 150 years ago seem to me to align again with what people now think the study of art should about: understanding how material objects are made by learning the processes by which they were made and by looking very carefully, using whatever methods best suit your object,” Koerner said. “That’s what a lot of the younger art historians are doing, even to the point of apprenticing themselves to weavers and printmakers.”</p>



<p>Koerner added that training the eye is even more important today, as visual images impact how we understand politics, especially in the new era of AI-produced images and digital falsification. Many HAA courses today, such as “<a href="https://haa.fas.harvard.edu/class/human-20-colloquium-visual-arts">A Colloquium in the Visual Arts</a>,” have “looking labs,” opportunities for classes to go to the Harvard Art Museums to examine objects and discuss them.</p>



<p>Both Pereda and Koerner hope the conference will serve to “rekindle” the close relationship between the department and the Harvard Art Museums and provide a space to celebrate and critically examine the field and its history.</p>



<p>“It’s inspiring to see that 150 years ago, people conceived of a future history of art&nbsp;in such a deep, foundational way,” Koerner said. “It was not just about learning the difference between a Rembrandt and one of his followers, or about appreciating beautiful things. It was really about what education should be ideally; about what it means, say, for undergraduates to learn to look closely at artworks and so do with advanced research ongoing at the University.”</p>

<p>Setti Warren’s job as director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School involved working with political luminaries and important scholars.</p>



<p>But those who knew him said he was the kind of person who made everyone he met feel like they mattered, especially his students.</p>



<p>“He wanted us to feel like we were valued, and heard, and cared for,” said Summer Tan ’26, IOP vice president. “I remember even when he was still interim director, he had taken the time to know my name and would greet me every time we passed in the hallway, no matter how busy he looked or how important the person he was walking with was.”</p>



<p>Friends, students, faculty, and members of the Harvard community remember the popular IOP director and the first elected Black mayor in Massachusetts as an optimistic bridge builder who did politics the right way and inspired young people with his lifelong love of public service.</p>



<p>Warren died at the age of 55 at his Newton home on Sunday.</p>

<p>“Setti had the superpower of knowing how to lift people up and create a shared sense of mission that was joyful.&nbsp;He listened hard, and he understood how to unlock the best in everybody,” said former U.S. Senator John Kerry, a longtime ally.</p>



<p>Warren worked on Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign and later joined the Massachusetts Democrat’s Senate staff. Kerry, who served as U.S. secretary of state during the Obama administration, called Warren a rare role model in this pugnacious political era.</p>



<p>“I hope that a big part of his legacy will be that he inspired a lot more Setti Warrens to carry on that tradition which our democracy needs so much right now. America needs more people with Setti’s moral compass who do the right thing for the right reasons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an announcement to the Harvard community, Kennedy School Dean Jeremy Weinstein and David Deming, dean of Harvard College, called the news “heartbreaking” and recounted Warren’s nearly four decades of public service, from the military to politics to academia, as “an example to us all.” Colleagues say he was a man of strongly held principles and deep faith who kept a curious and open mind.</p>

<p>“Setti lived and modeled the values that infuse this School: excellence, enterprise, collegiality and a muscular commitment to service,” said Nancy Gibbs, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, where Warren served as executive director in 2018 before joining the IOP in 2022.</p>



<p>“Setti made public service seem less like a sacrifice than a secular sacrament, a calling that pulls people to be their best selves,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Iraq War veteran, Warren entered politics in 1995, campaigning for President Bill Clinton&#8217;s re-election. He then went to work in the Clinton administration from 1996 to 2000.</p>



<p>In 2010, Warren, a Democrat and lifelong Newton native, was elected that city’s mayor, serving two terms. He later made two briefs runs at higher office. In 2011, he entered the race for U.S. Senate, a seat won by then-Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren. In 2017, he ran for governor of Massachusetts before coming to Harvard in 2018.</p>



<p>Many recall Warren’s unwavering dedication to his family, his students, and his constituents, along with his generosity of time and spirit.</p>

<p>“He was focused; he was energetic; he was always thinking about what was next and what else [needed] to be done, but he also had so much fun in the various roles that he held,” said Aaron Goldman, director of the JFK Jr. Forum, who began working with Warren in 2005 and held several top leadership roles during Warren’s eight years in Newton City Hall.</p>



<p>“He always wanted to hear about people’s days and hear about people’s lives and always seemed to find a common connection with somebody and something to reminisce about. Even in stressful, challenging moments, which there were plenty of, he always seemed to find the silver lining or the good in whatever we were dealing with,” Goldman said.</p>



<p>Warren is survived by his wife, Tassy Warren, who is <a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/people/tassy-warren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-executive director and chief strategy officer</a> at Harvard’s Center on the Developing Child. The couple have two children, Abigail and John. “To have him as a friend and colleague was to have a true champion in your corner,” said Liz Schwartz, the Shorenstein Center’s communications director.</p>



<p>For students, who left flowers and posted notes on his office door, Warren was much more than some school administrator. His office was a warm, welcoming refuge whose door never seemed to close.</p>



<p>Senior Ethan Kelly, a former IOP vice president, felt that Warren was looking out for him and credits Warren with sparking his pursuit of a career in politics.</p>



<p>“He was more than a director to me — and many others. He was a friend, an ally, a parental figure, a mentor, a public servant. He was everything someone ought to be if they choose to pursue a career in public service,” said Kelly.</p>

<p>Weinstein said, “Setti always encouraged students from across the political spectrum to run toward politics rather than run away from them, just like he did throughout his life. His students loved him, and he will live on through their legacies of service.”</p>



<p>Longtime friends say whether guiding young people or trying to solve constituents’ problems, Warren really was who he seemed to be.</p>



<p>“Setti cared deeply about others and was genuinely motivated to make the world a better place,” said Brigid O’Rourke, IOP director of communications, who has known Warren for almost 20 years. “That’s not something I say lightly. That’s who he was at his core. A kind and thoughtful man who was invested in his community and wanted the best for everyone, not just those who agreed with him.”</p>

<p>From medications to supplements to meditation apps, the market is flooded with products that claim to help people get the rest they need. And for good reason: It’s <a href="https://www.thensf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NSF_SIA_2025-Report_final.pdf">estimated</a> that six out of 10 Americans are sleep-deprived.</p>



<p>In this episode of “<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/harvard-thinking/">Harvard Thinking</a>,” host Samantha Laine Perfas is joined by three experts to discuss why sleep is critical to health and how to ensure we’re getting enough.</p>



<p>“Sleep affects every part of your being, every physiological process, every biological process, every psychological process,” said <a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/tony-cunningham">Tony Cunningham</a>, the director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition and the director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic in the psychiatry department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>Given how much sleep affects well-being, it’s surprising that more people don’t make it a priority, said <a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/rebecca-robbins">Rebecca Robbins</a>, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate sleep scientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</p>



<p>Part of the problem is that we’re often poor judges of our own sleep quality, according to <a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/matthew-d-weaver">Matthew Weaver</a>, an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an instructor in Harvard Medical School. The gold standard of sleep focuses on duration, consistency, and quality, he said, but recognizing that we can’t always achieve that, there are ways to move the needle on bettering our habits.</p>

<p><strong>Rebecca Robbins:</strong> In any other area, if we told someone we can increase your longevity, we can enhance the quality of your life, improve your health, your physical appearance — it’s healthy sleep. But so many people push back against that.</p>



<p><strong>Samantha Laine Perfas:</strong> The National Sleep Foundation estimates that six out of 10 adults in the U.S. aren’t getting enough sleep. In the short term, this affects things like our mood, energy, and memory. Long-term, it can lead to serious health consequences and take years off your life.</p>



<p>So how should we go about getting more, and better, sleep?</p>



<p>Welcome to “Harvard Thinking,” a podcast where the life of the mind meets everyday life. Today, I’m joined by:</p>



<p><strong>Tony Cunningham:</strong> Tony Cunningham and I’m the director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition, and the Director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic in the psychiatry department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> His primary research focus is understanding the role of sleep and sleep loss, and emotion and memory processing. Then:</p>



<p><strong>Matthew Weaver:</strong> Matthew Weaver. I’m an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> He’s also a member of the Harvard Work Hours Health and Safety Group and the Sleep Matters Initiative at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. And finally:</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Rebecca Robbins. I’m an assistant professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate sleep scientist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> She has a joint faculty appointment at Harvard Medical School and the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She also co-authored the book “Sleep for Success: Everything You Must Know About Sleep but Are Too Tired to Ask.”</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> And I’m your host, Samantha Laine Perfas. I’m a writer for The Harvard Gazette. Today we’ll explore some of the barriers to getting enough sleep, and how we might better set ourselves up for quality rest.</p>



<p>I think a good place to start for our listeners would be: Why is sleep so important?</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> I’ll kick things off here. I like to think of sleep as the great multiplier. Sleep affects every part of your being, every physiological process, every biological process, every psychological process. And it doesn’t do it in isolation. It does help your immune system, but it’s not just helping your immune system. It doesn’t just help your motivation. It doesn’t just help your recovery after a workout. It’s affecting all of those systems together. It’s one of those things where the total is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> To pick up where Tony left off, we are very poor judges of our own sleep quality. You can get into a rut where you feel you’re sleeping five, six hours a night and you think you can get by on that, and that sort of becomes your new normal very quickly. And once you start to implement better sleep practices and achieve better sleep, you start to feel some of these benefits that Tony was describing, and it becomes this positive feedback loop where you see how much better that you’re able to feel and function during the day, and it motivates you to continue better sleep practices.</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Sleep is one of the most powerful predictors of our health and our well-being today, tomorrow, and well into the future. But what’s so interesting is that sleep is also, despite being so vitally important and a significant contributor to so many areas of our waking success, it’s forgone by so many in our population. Only 30 percent of Americans report consistently getting enough sleep. So the data reveal that many Americans are falling short of their biological need for sleep and leaving so much on the table when it comes to their potential performance.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> What happens to our bodies if we don’t get enough sleep, both physically and mentally? What are some of the consequences?</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Virtually every aspect of our waking life suffers under conditions of sleep deprivation. When we’re falling short of some of the targets for healthy sleep — broadly defined, again, duration and consistency and quality are some of those ingredients — we wake up and our mood is one of the first things to go. So our mental health is intimately related to our sleep health. Without enough sleep, we’re more prone to feelings of anxiety and feelings of depression that, when unchecked, can snowball into longer-term diagnoses of anxiety or depression, or worse — suicidal ideation. We also see associations between sleep health and cardiovascular health. So our heart health is directly impacted by our sleep. When we’re not getting enough, our blood pressure goes up. We’re at greater risk for heart attacks, for stroke, and our cognitive health is also intimately linked to our sleep health. When we’re not getting enough sleep or getting good quality sleep, we wake up and we’re more likely to feel feelings of fogginess. We’re more likely to take longer to do tasks than when we’re well-rested. So our productivity suffers. Our creativity suffers. Our ethical decision-making also suffers. In the longer term, we also see an increased risk in the cognitive health category for neurocognitive decline. So those that are not getting enough sleep or chronically suffering from sleep difficulties are at greater risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia and early mortality.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Virtually every aspect of our waking life suffers under conditions of sleep deprivation.”</p><cite>Rebecca Robbins</cite></blockquote></div>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> Like Rebecca was saying, if you’re not getting good enough sleep, you’re more likely to experience negative mood symptoms and all the downstream clinical and psychiatric effects that has in store for you. And, to give some concrete examples of what we think is going on there is that there are emotional centers of your brain. There’s the amygdala, which is thought to be the emotional center of your brain. And what we see is, if people are deprived of sleep, that emotional center becomes hyperactive. So even things like emotional stimuli that they saw the day before, they’ve had time to process. Normally, across the night of sleep, you are less reactive to it. Those areas of the brain are less responsive to it. But if you take somebody and you deprive them of sleep, their brains actually become more reactive than the first time that they experienced it. They become hyperactive in that situation. And what we think, beyond that, is going on is that there are actual areas of our brain that are important for executive function, which is important for decision-making, things like that. It’s called the frontal regions of our brain, or frontal lobe. And we think regions of that area of our brain help to put the brakes on the emotional centers of our brain. And effectively, when we don’t get enough sleep, the brakes get cut and we are just unable to as effectively put the brakes on our own emotional centers of our brain, and that’s when things can start to spiral out of control on us.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> Could you talk a little bit more about the connection between mental health and sleep?</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> There’s definitely a relationship between serious mental health and sleep. And I think the way it really expresses itself, for the most part, is within recovery and within severity. If you’re treating somebody with depression and you don’t treat their sleep symptoms, even if they recover from the depression symptoms, they’re much more likely to relapse later if they’re still having sleep issues after the treatment. And then in other disorders, specifically one study I know about, in patients with psychosis, the patients that had comorbid sleep disorders had much higher severity symptoms of their psychosis than those that did not have a comorbid sleep disorder.</p>

<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> There is such a tight relationship between mood and our sleep. And for example, medical residents in their first year of training experience very challenging schedules and have a limited opportunity for sleep. And we’ve seen a linear relationship with increasing adjusted odds of depression with increasing work hours in that setting. Police officers who screen positive for sleep disorder are much more likely to report burnout. They’re rated as being more difficult to get along with by their colleagues. They have more citizen complaints lodged against them, more likely to make errors in simulation studies of shoot or don’t shoot situations, alluding to that risky behavior. Sleep deficiency has a pervasive impact on all aspects of our life.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> Yeah, that’s really interesting to think about, and it does seem to me that some people seem to be better at sleeping than others. I am thinking about my husband, and he’s one of those people where he can lay down and within a minute he’s out and he’s out for the night. And I’m on the other side tossing and turning, and I can’t sleep. I’m so tired, but my brain just won’t shut off. But it makes me wonder if some people just have a predisposition to sleep better or if they’re naturally able to fall asleep faster, sleep longer, or sleep shorter than other people.</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> I’d love to jump on this one because this is like a personal mission, that I feel like I need to help get the message out about this, because to answer your question, yes, there are individual differences in both — the ease with which people fall asleep, but also the amount of sleep that people need. And I’m not sure everybody will agree with me. I’m not sure everyone in the sleep field will agree. But sleep is normally distributed, which means the largest number of people out there need about eight hours of sleep. That’s still only between 25 to 35 percent of the population that biologically, physiologically need eight hours of sleep. That means there’s a lot of the population on either end of that spectrum. Where I see people tend to struggle when they come and see me because of clinical sleep issues very frequently, it’s because there are people on the lower end of the spectrum that are trying to get eight hours of sleep and they just don’t need it. They may only need six, six and a half hours of sleep, and that’s fine for them. That’s all they physiologically and biologically need. Now, I’m going to immediately speak out of the other side of my mouth and say a lot more of us think we’re those people, a lot more of us think that we’re six-, six-and-a-half-hour sleepers when we’re not really. But if you are striving on a nightly basis to hit that eight-hour number and it is not coming, and you’re starting to get stressed about it, and it’s starting to actually impair your ability to fall asleep because you’re getting so stressed about it, it might be worth talking to somebody to see if you can take the gas off a little bit and shoot for a lower number, get the best quality six and a half hours of sleep that you can get, and then, maybe worry about duration after that.</p>



<p>While eight hours is the most common number, it is not the only number. And so it’s really important to figure out what your number is.</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Sleep is deeply psychological, and I think sometimes we can get into these ruts behaviorally and start to tell ourselves a story of, you know, I’m a bad sleeper, or I’m a good sleeper. We are all different; our personal sleep profiles are different. And I couldn’t agree more, Tony, that the public health message of get eight hours — while in many ways is beneficial to get the word out about how much we need — the truth is, many of us are far from that number and need to move at least — if you’re a five-hour sleeper, I think we can all agree at least need to move a little bit higher, such that the range for adults is somewhere between seven and nine hours. But we’re all different in a different place along that continuum. Sleep can be extremely personal in trying to find your thumbprint of your preferred fall-asleep time.</p>



<p>And by the way, that might be different than your partner’s. I think awareness is everything, and just the fact that we are all different. But I might also just add that one of the contributors to sleep difficulties can be differences in how we manage our worries or tasks or the things in our lives. We do have good data to show that women wear, often, one hat outside the home and another hat inside the home. And there are more of the small day-to-day tasks that women typically share than men. So I do hear from a lot of women in our studies and friends that, “My mind is buzzing when I want to be falling asleep, and then I’m doing all the wrong things. I know that I’m scrolling Instagram and I shouldn’t do that.”</p>

<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> Do you have any advice for people who fall in that category?</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> If you are on the category of maybe feeling like you’re taking a little bit longer or struggling to fall asleep, really draw a lot of attention to your bedtime, wind-down routine. And I don’t think it has to be that hard. I think if you boil it down to maybe three things that calm you and soothe you, and if that’s writing about your day, if it’s maybe writing down some to-dos that are lingering in your mind. If it’s reading a couple pages in a book, taking a warm shower, whatever’s relaxing to you, try to think of those two or three things and rinse and repeat that night after night. And your body and your brain are going to start to understand that what comes after those things is sleep. And understanding that is all part of sleep. The bedtime process, we think, “Oh, all right, I’m done with my work, putting the kids to bed, all these things. My day’s done, now I can sleep.” And then we crawl into bed and then we’re frustrated because we can’t fall asleep. But we have to build in time to get ourselves set up for success when it comes to sleep.</p>



<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I love that. And related to this, also in terms of not beating yourself up when you feel like you’ve been sleeping poorly, there are multiple domains to sleep health. We’re increasingly recognizing that regularity may be just as important as duration. The quality of the sleep that you get matters a lot. I think about those other aspects of optimizing your sleep. We had recently collaborated with the National Sleep Foundation on a review concerning sleep regularity, and obviously found that regularity is very important. When you reduce your regularity, there’s an increased risk of metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease, worse mood, a variety of outcomes, but also among those who are not sleeping long enough during the week, specifically, if they’re sleeping five or six hours during the week, catching up on their sleep on the weekends by up to two hours was not found to be harmful. It was found to be actually helpful. So if you’re not getting enough sleep and you need to extend a little bit on the weekends, as long as you’re not overdoing it, that’s beneficial as well.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-right:0;margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-left:0"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you’re not getting enough sleep and you need to extend a little bit on the weekends, as long as you’re not overdoing it, that’s beneficial as well.”</p><cite>Matthew Weaver</cite></blockquote></div>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> Tony, you mentioned that everybody needs different amounts of sleep. I was also thinking about how that can differ throughout your lifetime, like your sleep needs as a baby versus an 18-year-old versus a 60-year-old. How do our sleep needs ebb and flow throughout the course of our lifetimes?</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> It definitely evolves throughout our lifespan. And at least some evidence that I’ve seen, the first brain state in the womb is thought to be REM sleep, which is really interesting as one of the stages of sleep. Which makes sense when you start to learn that REM sleep is really important for brain development. It is actually like the structural development of your brain, and what’s called long-term potentiation, kind of making these new neural connections. And so that may actually be our first level of consciousness in this world. And from there we go from about 16 hours of sleep as a newborn — 16 hours of sleep, eight hours awake during the day, in which your time spent asleep is about evenly split between REM sleep and other stages of sleep. And then it just goes down from there, and both the structure of your sleep and the duration of your sleep change a lot throughout, especially puberty. So you go through different stages of puberty, and that’s where you see the structure of your sleep really make a lot of changes. And then it stabilizes to some extent once you hit adulthood.</p>



<p>And I will insert here, I love the concepts of giving yourself grace, as Matt and Rebecca have been talking about, if you are struggling with sleep because you enter those like, late twenties, thirties, forties when it’s busy. I know a couple of us have small children that really take our sleep for a bit of a loop. So giving yourself a little bit of grace during that time, but prioritizing it when you can. And then you enter older adulthood, where the recommendation for amount of sleep actually drops a little bit. Once you’re hitting those older adult years, like 60 plus, there are again more brain changes that might be affecting your ability to stay asleep and get the same level of sleep stages that you’ve got before. But it doesn’t mean you should settle for less. I see a lot of older adults in my clinic that think they could be doing better, and in most cases, they can.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> There was some interesting research done during the pandemic that showed how sleep was affected during that period of time. What did we learn, and were there any takeaways?</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Dr. Weaver and I have published quite a bit on this, and our research showed at the beginning of the pandemic we saw, in a global sample, that there was an average 25-minute increase in sleep duration. We thought that was an overwhelmingly positive outcome of COVID-19; those that were able to work from home and shelter in place were able to benefit from a little bit more sleep. And what wonderful news, because we know that sleep is a really important part of a healthy immune system; amid exposure to pathogens, how wonderful that our population was able to get a little bit more sleep. And we saw that overall, that moved our global society from being in the red, as we’d say, below the recommended seven hours, to above that mark. So it was a positive outcome of the pandemic in the early weeks and months. But as the pandemic wore on, we started to see an increase in what we lovingly referred to as COVID-somnia. There were quite a few complaints of sleep difficulties, searches online for insomnia symptoms and sleep remedies, because one of the most important things for all of us when it comes to our sleep is feeling at peace as we fall asleep and feeling as though we’re certain about what tomorrow holds. And for a long time during the pandemic, we didn’t have that.</p>



<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I think this relates back to what Tony mentioned in the beginning about individual thumbprints of sleep needs that were all quite different. And in the context of the pandemic, we on average had more flexibility in our sleep timing. We could control our own schedules a bit more and sleep at the time that was biologically appropriate for us and wake up at a time that was the same. So that increased freedom. I think we did see a shift in sleep timing during the pandemic, that was a little bit greater than actually the difference in sleep duration that was observed overall. That individual freedom helps us set our own schedules that work for us. And I also think over the long term, if you’re thinking, culturally that we’re sleeping less than we used to years ago, we’ve had major cultural changes to our society and one of the things that facilitated them was the increasing accessibility or proliferation of artificial lights. Light’s the most powerful resetting signal for our circadian rhythms. It suppresses the release of the hormone melatonin. It shifts our bed timing later. So when you have access to self-selected lighting in your home, you tend to stay up later, go to bed later. And that’s been over the longer term, something that has enabled us to probably sleep less than we used to and harm our overall sleep practices.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> I am also wondering if there’s a little bit of stigma associated with sleep. This, oh, if you sleep in, you’re lazy, you’ve got to get up, seize the day, get everything started pretty early. Do you think that plays a role in our quality of sleep?</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> That’s a great question. I think for so many years we’ve worn sleep deprivation like a badge of honor, and we viewed sleep as the price we have to pay in order to succeed. But all of our data show that the opposite is true. It’s remarkable: In any other area, if we told someone we can increase your longevity, we can enhance the quality of your life, improve your health, your physical appearance, it’s healthy sleep. But so many people push back against that.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--48)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“For so many years we’ve worn sleep deprivation like a badge of honor, and we viewed sleep as the price we have to pay in order to succeed. But all of our data show that the opposite is true.”</p><cite>Rebecca Robbins</cite></blockquote></div>



<p>For so long, we as a society viewed sleep as a pejorative. Whenever you get enough sleep, you don’t really hear people talking about it. You only hear the opposite, which then can contribute to this idea that poor sleep is socially normative, and if you’re getting enough sleep, something’s wrong with you. And so I hope that in our lifetime we might see a reversal of that, such that sleep becomes viewed as an essential part of anyone who’s interested in high performance.</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> A particular group that I think gets pointed at with this blame is teenagers, and it’s really just not fair because not only are they at a time of their life where they really need a lot of sleep, but their circadian rhythms are shifting later. This is part of that pubertal development, part of that change of sleep that I mentioned earlier, is their bedtimes get shifted later and later. And guess what? School start times aren’t helping them out either.</p>



<p>They’re not really feeling tired until maybe midnight or 1 a.m., and then they have to be up at 7, 7:30. God forbid if they’re a swimmer, they’re up at 5 in the morning. And they’re really having to cut their sleep off on a fairly regular basis. And that’s one group in particular that I think we need to have more care for how is our society set up, especially at such a pivotal time of development.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> Another group I think we need to give a little more grace to is parents of young children. As someone who is up every two to three hours currently to feed a baby, it’s brutal to then have to go into your day as usual when your sleep is interrupted so much.</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> Totally, Sam, and I think we do a disservice to so many parents, because the sleep community has often said, “Oh, nap when your baby naps.” And I have two little ones. And I remember those days and being so frustrated with that advice.</p>



<p>That’s a time of life that’s just fraught with sleep difficulties. And, you have very little control over your schedule. You’re so driven by caring for this beautiful little baby, but it’s challenging. And then you can’t abide by that advice to sleep when the baby naps because your house is a mess, right? You have laundry to do, you have bottles to clean. So I like much better the advice to when you can sleep and the baby’s down, to try to recoup some of the sleep loss.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> So let’s say you are someone who recognizes, “I need more sleep. I need to prioritize my sleep.” You would think it would be as simple as then just get more sleep, or to go to what I lovingly call Dr. Google and ask, “How do I get more sleep?” Could you talk about some of the sleep myths that are out there or some of the suggestions that are actually counterproductive?</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> We got together a list of the most common myths about sleep and published it in our journal of Sleep Health not too long ago. And there were quite a few. But number one, the myth that there’s some people out there that do great on less than seven hours. and they do exist, but they are extremely, extremely rare, and not well studied. Other myths are that alcohol is a good thing for sleep. And we do find that maybe, depending on your body mass, one dose of alcohol could maybe help you feel a little bit sleepy, reduce stress a little bit if consumed with food a little bit earlier in the day, but close to bedtime and consumed in excess is not going to be helpful for your sleep.</p>



<p>Another one of our myths is that your brain can learn to function on less sleep. I hear this from our students who are undergrads and going into finance all the time. They’re like, “I need to start training myself!” Unfortunately, that will only hinder your ability to be successful there. Other myths are adults sleep more as they get older. We see that we’re in the best sleep shape when we’re actually about the age 38 or maybe 40, and our sleep systems can start to decline after that. Do older adults need less sleep? No, but they unfortunately struggle a little bit more than younger adults in their ability, their fundamental ability to get good sleep. One of the other big ones was being able to fall asleep anytime, anywhere is the sign of a good sleeper. Falling asleep fast is not a sign always of good sleep. If you are starved for nutrition, you haven’t eaten for several days, you know, you’re going to sit down at a table and help yourself to as much food as possible. If you’re not getting good sleep, you’re going to be starved for sleep and fall asleep very quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I totally agree. We often talk with professionals in different occupations, like police officers, firefighters, and they’ll say, “I can drink coffee right up till the moment I go to bed. I can sleep instantly.” What that means is you’re chronically sleep deprived, and you need more sleep than you’re getting. There are many of us out there who think we can get by on four hours of sleep. As we mentioned earlier, we’re just not good judges of our own sleep deprivation. I think we all appreciate the increased attention that sleep is getting these days. And with that come a variety of hacks. I would say have a healthy level of skepticism for things that are suggested that seem a bit off the wall. Sleep hygiene tips are super basic, like we mentioned earlier in this conversation. It’s a cool, dark environment. It’s a healthy wind-down routine. It’s prioritizing it and allowing yourself enough time in that environment to fall asleep naturally. Those are the key things. There’s not like a magic pill that’s going to necessarily help you out.</p>

<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> What are the pros and cons of sleep supports like melatonin, magnesium, even medication?</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> When we talk about a treatment decision, right? When we see people clinically who are having chronic sleep issues and we’re trying to make a decision as to how we’re going to treat them. Do we want to do a behavioral intervention — I do cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, CBTI — that’s considered the gold-standard frontline behavioral treatment for insomnia symptoms. Now, one of the problems is there are not enough providers out there for the number of people who are having sleep issues.</p>



<p>There is definitely a place for medications and for melatonin. I think one of the problems is we want to use those things as acutely as possible. So if you’re having a specific period in which sleep is going be negatively impacted or going through a specific stressful time — you have a traumatic event, maybe something really has rattled you and sleep is going to be a priority for a while — that would be a time in which sleep physicians would be more inclined to use medications. If it’s more of a long-term chronic issue and you really want to be at the root of the problem, that’s when you’re going to want to get in line for a behavioral sleep medicine interventionist.</p>



<p>And then melatonin, I think my biggest issue with it is people don’t really take it correctly. What they end up doing is take a giant bowl of melatonin right before they’re going to bed, which is way more than you could possibly need, and it’s not giving it enough time to actually act. My understanding of melatonin is that it’s supposed to just kickstart your natural production. Basically, it becomes like a feedback loop where if you have a little bit of melatonin in your system, it will then kickstart your natural melatonin production. And so the ideal way of taking it is a much smaller dose a couple hours, potentially even two to three hours, before your determined bedtime to give your body the time to produce the melatonin that it needs.</p>



<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> Yeah, I agree. And melatonin in particular, it’s worth trying. It’s something that your body’s secreting naturally, but it may be secreting it at an inappropriate time, particularly if your sleep is irregular. So if you want to sleep at a different time than you usually do, it can be helpful. If you’re traveling, changing time zones, it can be helpful. As Tony mentioned, things to keep in mind are inappropriate dose. What is commonly sold at, say, Walgreens, CVS, are 3, 5, 10 milligrams. It’s not necessarily, it’s not regulated by the FDA. So, we would recommend making sure that you get a pharmaceutical-grade version of melatonin and take a small dose. We recommend starting at half a milligram and you can give it a try. </p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> And just to underscore what Dr. Weaver just said, a half a milligram, and that’s far less than what you can find in a typical grocery store or drug store. It is many factors higher than that. And it’s not a better situation. I know this is a little bit of a myth that melatonin is a sleep aid. It really is a circadian rhythm intervention, and I think it’s unfortunately broadly labeled to consumers as a sleep aid.</p>



<p><strong>Laine Perfas:</strong> As we wrap up, I had one last question, which is a little bit funny since Matt mentioned that he is suspicious of many sleep hacks, but I wanted to ask each of you if you had a favorite sleep hack, either that has worked for you personally or people that you have treated.</p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> So the two I would go to, clinically speaking – and I’m going to call it recommendations, I don’t even want to call it a hack. You want your bedroom to be nice and cool temperatures. You want it to be dark, and you want it to be relatively quiet. I do like white noise. White noise is okay. But you don’t want a lot of background noise. You don’t want TV going, stuff like that. And then the other thing that, again, if I’m going to have somebody focus on one thing with regards to their sleep, timing and duration. It’s to try to keep as consistent of a rise time each day. It’s not just sleep duration, it’s sleep regularity. Like Matt said, there’s some room for flexibility, right, like catching up on sleep, or there’s also some research that you can sleep-bank ahead of time, too, and that will help if you know you’re going to have some issues. But on a long-term scale, if you are able to keep a consistent rise time each day, pretty close, will just help it make sure that you’re tired by your bedtime the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Weaver:</strong> I totally agree, and I guess I’d call it a strategy more than a hack, but agree with all Tony’s points. Cool. Dark. Quiet. I also use white noise. I find that to be very helpful. And be conscious of the lighting in advance of the bedtime, so keep it pretty dim an hour before bed incorporated in your wind-down routine; reading from a physical book rather than your phone in general is helpful for me at least, is my own sort of hack. And one thing that is increasingly popular on social media is the importance of light in the morning. And there’s actually really strong evidence base for that. So I’m a big believer in bright sunlight early in the morning. It will help you sleep later that night and keep you on a regular sleep schedule.</p>



<p><strong>Robbins:</strong> The good news, as you see in all of these suggestions, is small changes can go a really long way, and they start tonight. And I like this idea of, I am my own “n-of-one” experiment, and let me try these things and see what maybe I’m doing that is hurting my sleep and how can I change that? And then what might be helping, and how can I lean more into that? Earlier dinners are good, keeping your last time you’re eating pretty far away from your bedtime. And there’s like a constellation of things that really help surrounding sleep itself to set you up for success.</p>



<p>I think the only other thing I’d add is just the bedtime routine. Sam, as a parent, you’re very acutely aware of your child’s bedtime routine, and I think we all are, across our society, focused on kids and getting them on track. And then we forget that as adults we actually need that same routine. And again, we need to feel like we’re at peace and we can drift off into sleep. And I think it’s harder and harder to find that in today’s day and age, especially if you’re looking at your phone before bedtime. If you’re able to pick three things that soothe you and think about what really relaxes you the most — is that going to the spa? Then maybe pick up a hand cream that you find to be soothing. Do a little gentle massage of your cervical spine. Some gentle yoga that you find relaxing, an up-dog, a down-dog, and then find a comfortable seat. And maybe if you find that you have a busy mind before bedtime, practice a couple breathing exercises. And you can come back to being at peace in the present moment. And that is what sleep is all about, feeling at peace, and that’s how you drift off.</p>

<p><em>At a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Nov. 4, 2025, the following tribute to the life and service of the late Roger Owen was spread upon the permanent records of the Faculty.</em></p>



<p>E.R.J. Owen — simply “Roger” to his family, friends, and colleagues — died on Dec. 22, 2018, at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is widely remembered and celebrated as a prolific scholar whose pioneering contributions to the study of modern Middle Eastern history have reshaped the field substantively, conceptually, and methodologically.</p>



<p>Born in London in 1935, Owen’s interest in the Middle East started to take shape after he was sent to Cyprus in 1955, then under British colonial rule, for his mandatory military service. While there, as he wrote in his memoirs, he “discovered how close Nicosia was by plane to Tel Aviv, East Jerusalem, Beirut and Cairo,” which initiated his travels in the region while on leaves and after demobilization. It was then that he “got really hooked on the East as a result of the heady combination of the sweet early summer evenings, Biblical ruins, and the insistent hammer of contemporary politics.” After his return to London, he briefly considered a career in the Foreign Office. Instead, he enrolled at the University of Oxford, where he earned a B.A. from Magdalen College in 1959 and a doctoral degree in social sciences, specializing in economic history, from St Antony’s College in 1965.</p>



<p>Owen’s distinguished career as an academic started at Oxford, where he remained until 1993, the year he joined the Department of History at Harvard University as the A.J. Meyer Professor of Middle East History. At Harvard, he taught courses on various aspects of the modern Middle East, organized workshops and conferences that brought together scholars from different disciplines and areas, and mentored many students who now occupy leading positions as academics or professionals in different parts of the United States and the world. While at Harvard, he also served the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES) as director and in many other roles as a leading member of a team of Middle East scholars who aimed to ground their field of study in the rigorous disciplines of the social and human sciences and move away from the nebulous notion of “area studies.”</p>



<p>Starting with Owen’s earliest publications, his work had and continues to have significant influence precisely because he represented and argued for a new approach to the Middle East that offered a compelling critique of those that prevailed into the 1970s: namely, Orientalism and the modernization paradigm. He disparaged the assumption that “Islam,” “Islamic society,” or “traditional society” could be productive units of analysis to understand the living, changing, evolving, and highly variegated societies of the region where he continued to travel, reside for lengthy periods, and develop robust ties and friendships. In workshops he organized together with a number of like-minded intellectuals at the University of Hull, the “Hull Group,” and in journals he co-conceived and co-edited, he forged the substance and tone of that critique, which deeply informed Owen’s empirically rich and methodologically sophisticated studies in political economy.</p>



<p>Characterized as an “intellectual amphibian” in his Festschrift, Owen was equally comfortable as an economic and a political historian, in quantitative and qualitative analysis, and he was critical of the generalizations, essentializations, and facile theoretical discourses that both might encourage. As the titles of his books demonstrate, he gradually moved from economic to political themes, but, throughout his career, he remained true to both sides of his early focus on political economy.</p>



<p>Owen’s major works include: “Cotton and the Egyptian Economy, 1820–1914” (1969); “The Middle East in the World Economy, 1800–1914” (1981); “State, Power and Politics in the Making of the Modern Middle East” (1992); “A History of Middle East Economies in the Twentieth Century” (1999, co-authored); and “The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life” (2012).</p>



<p>In Owen’s last decade at Harvard, he experimented with a genre, biography, that seemed like a departure from his earlier work, but, even then, he continued to ground his work in political economy. His insightful study of the life and times of Lord Cromer not only enabled him to engage with the role of the individual in history but also to take a close look at British colonial rule in Egypt and its impact on Egyptian economy and society. Also at Harvard, he slightly changed his stance vis-à-vis the media and did not shun occasionally wearing the hat of a “minor pundit,” in his own words.</p>



<p>Of the many awards Owen received during his distinguished career, one of the most meaningful and impactful came in 2011, when a Roger Owen Book Award was established by the Middle East Studies Association of North America. Since then, the award has been given biennially to the author of the best new monograph on “the economics, economic history, or the political economy of the Middle East and North Africa.”</p>



<p>A towering intellectual, Owen was also blessed with the lasting friendship of his colleagues and students, who not only benefited from his learning and his generously critical insights into their work or into world affairs but also, and famously, enjoyed his good company. Even in his final years, when he bravely weathered a progressive illness, Owen did not give up on his active social and intellectual life. He was an unfailingly engaging conversationalist, not a talker, definitely not “royalty.” His post-retirement presence at CMES in weekly breakfast meetings with students, staff, and colleagues, known as Bagels with Roger, is remembered for his effortless displays of deep wisdom, sparkling wit, and sheer fun. He is still regarded as the dean of economic historians of the Middle East.</p>



<p>Owen is survived by three children, Kate, Ben, and Isabel, seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.</p>



<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

<p><em>At a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Nov. 4, 2025, the following tribute to the life and service of the late Ralph Mitchell was spread upon the permanent records of the Faculty.</em></p>



<p>In an interview with The Harvard Crimson in 2015, Professor Ralph Mitchell said, “Even though we can’t see them, microbes are central to everything that happens to humans. In fact, without microbes, the world just wouldn’t work.” With his passing, Harvard has lost one of its greatest advocates for microbial sciences.</p>



<p>For his first degree, Ralph studied microbiology at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. An Irish immigrant, he moved to New York in 1956 to begin his Ph.D. studies at Cornell University. A grant from the United Fruit Company related to banana wilt disease sponsored his studies. He began his independent academic career with an appointment in environmental microbiology by joining the nascent Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, in 1962.</p>



<p>Subsequently, Ralph joined Harvard in 1966 as an Assistant Professor of Applied Biology in (what was then called) the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics. After a number of seminal papers on microbial and viral growth and death in aquatic environments, he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1969 and became the Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Biology in 1970 in what subsequently became the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 2007. After an illustrious career studying microbes in a dizzying number of habitats, Ralph became Professor <em>Emeritus</em> in 2009. In retirement, he was also active as an adjunct professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University, near his family.</p>



<p>Ralph was an exceptional researcher and a world-renowned scientist who was a pioneer in the field of interface microbial ecology, which focuses on understanding the interactions between microorganisms and living or non-living materials. Through both basic and applied projects, he found that microbes, as well as the solvents in polymers, can produce chemical cues that trigger chemotaxis, the process by which animal larvae settle on surfaces. He also laid the foundation for understanding the role of microbes in metal corrosion and, later, in the degradation of materials and objects of cultural significance, from Chilean and Egyptian mummies to the Apollo astronauts’ spacesuits. He was a giant in the field of environmental microbiology, serving as the founding editor of the leading journal Microbial Ecology. He also founded and edited an ecological and applied microbiology book series for more than 20 years. This series included many important books that influenced generations of researchers, including titles such as “Biology of Anaerobic Microorganisms,” “Biofilms,” “Microbial Transformation and Degradation of Toxic Organic Chemicals,” and his own “Environmental Microbiology.”</p>



<p>Ralph embodied the philosophy of applying an expertise in basic science (bacterial films) to many real-world applications and impacts. This combination made him a leading contributor to solutions to problems of microbial biodegradation, biofouling, bio-corrosion, and hydrogen embrittlement. He had wide-ranging impacts across government and industry. For example, he worked on microbial contamination in production lines, electronic-insulation materials, and biodeterioration of polymeric composite materials for major companies. He also worked on projects involving corrosion control for a suspension cable of a major bridge, fungal degradation of concrete, and corrosion and protective coatings for the water cycling system of the International Space Station. Understanding the important role microorganisms play in the fate of our material culture, he directed his skills toward preservation of paintings, sculptures, and even archaeological sites, such as the Mayan pyramids and Pearl Harbor. His contributions to the knowledge of the biodeterioration of cultural material were foundational. Throughout his career, he greatly fostered interactions and important bridge building between cultural resource professionals and the scientific community.</p>



<p>Ralph cared deeply about teaching. He often spoke with joy about leading the Harvard first-year seminar called “Germs.” He believed that sharing knowledge and scientific tools with students was a vital responsibility of faculty. His commitment to educating the next generation constitutes a central part of his enduring legacy. Furthermore, he had a particular gift for making junior faculty and students feel valued and heard. His wisdom never came with fanfare; it came with a smile, a story, or a steady word of encouragement. He embodied quiet brilliance, generous mentorship, and a deep love of science.</p>



<p>Ralph was happy and proud to always devote time to family throughout his life. He was dedicated to his wife, Muriel, throughout their adventure together across 59 years. He is survived by three daughters and six grandchildren.</p>

<p>The atmosphere on campus has been tense, and many have felt hurt, isolated, and afraid since the start of the Israel-Hamas War. The first step to forgiveness and reconciliation is both simple and difficult, according to campus religious leaders.</p>



<p>Just sit together and listen.</p>



<p>That was the message of a Parents’ Weekend panel, “Moving Forward at Harvard: A Conversation on Forgiveness.” Imam Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Rabbi Getzel Davis, and the Rev. Matthew Ichihashi Potts discussed their faiths’ approaches to bridging divisions amid anguish and intense disagreement.</p>



<p>Moderator and Associate Dean of Culture &amp; Community Alta Mauro noted that the issues are complex and embedded. So lasting solutions will have to stretch beyond simple policy changes and toward strategies that build stronger community connections.</p>



<p>Davis reflected on the challenges.</p>



<p>“I’ve been here for 13 years,” he said. “I’m really acutely aware of the suffering and struggles that many Jewish and Israeli students had on campus. I also understand how many Muslim students and Arab students also felt incredibly stuck and targeted and afraid — and how hard it was for Christians and atheists and Buddhists and Hindus and Zoroastrians and for so many of us here.”</p>



<p>Davis, the inaugural director of interfaith engagement, said there were obstacles to seeking forgiveness, among them the fact that “no one asks forgiveness in our society.”</p>



<p>It’s not only hard, he explained, but potentially dangerous. Those who ask for forgiveness and admit fault may open themselves to lawsuits. They might get physically injured or targeted for harassment.</p>



<p>Another difficulty with forgiveness on Harvard’s campus, he said, was that many of the worst actors in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel — like those who doxxed students or defaced Harvard Hillel — were not members of the community.</p>



<p>“As a result,” he said, “the people who should be asking for forgiveness aren’t here to do that.”</p>



<p>In some ways, he explained, the family weekend conversation, part of the new programming from the interfaith initiative of the president’s office, was less about forgiveness and more about how to build stronger communities that allow people to get to know one another despite differences and disagree in more constructive ways.</p>



<p>In describing how to achieve this sort of reconciliation, Abdur-Rashid, the University’s first full-time Muslim chaplain, described some of the rituals for forgiveness in the Islamic tradition.</p>



<p>“It becomes a process of parties coming together multiple times, to hear each other, to be with each other,” he said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-harvard-quote harvard-quote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--64);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--64)"><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It becomes a process of parties coming together multiple times, to hear each other, to be with each other.&#8221;</p><cite>Imam Khalil Abdur-Rashid</cite></blockquote></div>



<p>In the beginning, he said, groups who are at odds meet together with trusted mediators and plenty of food — anything to get people talking. Deeper levels of discussion and eventually agreement only come after the parties show that they’re willing to engage.</p>



<p>“At least both parties are able to bear what they have and be together,” he said, “and eventually they’ll get to that point [of reconciliation].”</p>



<p>He discussed how this process plays out across Islamic societies and how the same style of dialogue can play out on campus if members of the campus community — from faculty and staff to students and administrators — simply open up space for people to converse across differences.</p>



<p>“Forgiveness is a fruit that is born after the labor of sowing,” he said. “So you leave it at the end, but you sow it in the beginning.” This sowing, he said, is communal. “This is what we’re trying to do on campus,” he said.</p>



<p>Core to the process is that forgiveness can take many forms and degrees.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it can be hearing someone say, “I forgive you.” Other times, he said, it can be just “the willingness to sit in the same room and be together in dialogue and grief.”</p>



<p>The conversation reminded him of a line he’d heard from a former University administrator: “At Harvard, we’re really great at teaching our students to be leaders. … But one thing we’re not really good at is teaching our students to follow.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, Abdur-Rashid shared, students could look to those on campus with experience bridging divides and try to follow in their footsteps, rather than going at it alone.</p>



<p>In his introduction, Potts, the Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, joked that he was grateful to have been invited for a number of reasons — one being that he wrote a book on the subject, “Forgiveness: An Alternative Account.”</p>



<p>Summarizing his work, he described how the Christian concept of forgiveness, when the Bible was translated to Greek, developed an economic association. The complex process of forgiveness became conflated with the simpler idea of forgiving a debt. Potts compared two extreme cases: forgiving someone for stealing $10 and forgiving someone for killing one of your family members. One is easily resolvable, and the other is a betrayal that cannot be undone.</p>



<p>He said the economic connotation of forgiveness made Christianity particularly burdensome for marginalized Christian communities: people of color, women, queer people.</p>



<p>“These are the folks to whom Christians are always saying, ‘You must forgive,’” Potts explained. “‘You are not allowed to be angry, and you must reconcile with those who have harmed you.’”</p>



<p>Potts said that forgiveness is much more complicated than reconciliation.</p>



<p>The Bible, he said, doesn’t tell people that they must reconcile, nor that they must not be angry. “Love can be angry,” he said. “We have to figure out how to use that anger in a caring, loving way and not in a harmful way.”</p>



<p>To that point, he said, forgiveness on campus is not going to be a simple process. Though some people who conducted themselves poorly came from off campus, Potts said there are still plenty of people within the Harvard community who are hurting.</p>



<p>“If we are going to do something like forgiveness at scale in community,” Potts concluded, “we have to start learning how to hold one another’s anger, be able to listen to one another’s anger, acknowledge one another, but to do it in ways that dignify the person with whom we are angry.”</p>



<p>Echoing the ideas of Davis and Abdur-Rashid, Potts called for more openness and more opportunities to express it.</p>



<p>“I think what forgiveness looks like is creating the kind of spaces on our campus where people can actually speak to one another, honestly and frankly, about the mistrust that lingers,” he said. It’s in those spaces, he said, where people can really see the ties that bind us together.</p>

<p>Increasing your steps by even a little bit may help slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease among people at heightened risk, according to a new study.</p>



<p>In a paper published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03955-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Medicine</a>, Mass General Brigham researchers&nbsp;found that physical activity was associated with slower rates of cognitive decline in older adults with elevated levels of amyloid-beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer’s.</p>



<p>Cognitive decline was delayed by three years on average for people who walked just 3,000-5,000 steps per day, and by seven years in people who walked 5,000-7,500 steps per day. Sedentary individuals had a significantly faster buildup of tau proteins in the brain and more rapid declines in cognition and daily functioning.</p>



<p>“This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer’s disease trajectory don’t decline as quickly as others,” said senior author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19278/jasmeer-chhatwal?cmp=nwsref">Jasmeer Chhatwal</a> of the Mass General Brigham&nbsp;Department of Neurology. “Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.”</p>

<p>“Lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>The researchers analyzed data from 296 participants aged 50-90 years old in the&nbsp;<a href="https://habs.mgh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvard Aging Brain Study</a>&nbsp;who were all cognitively unimpaired at the beginning of the study. They used PET brain scans to measure baseline levels of amyloid-beta in plaques and tau in tangles and assessed the participants’ physical activity using waistband pedometers. The participants received annual follow-up cognitive assessments for between two and 14 years (average, 9.3 years), and a subset received repeated PET scans to track changes in tau.</p>



<p>Higher step counts were linked to slower rates of cognitive decline and a slower buildup of tau proteins in participants with elevated baseline levels of amyloid-beta. The researchers’ statistical modeling suggested that most of the physical activity benefits associated with slowing cognitive decline were driven by slower tau buildup. By contrast, in people with low baseline levels of amyloid-beta, there was very little cognitive decline or accumulation of tau proteins over time and no significant associations with physical activity.</p>

</p>



<p>“We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health,” said co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://habs.mgh.harvard.edu/our-team/reisa-sperling-md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reisa Sperling</a>, a neurologist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. “These findings show us that it’s possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. This is particularly encouraging for our quest to ultimately prevent Alzheimer’s disease dementia, as well as to decrease dementia due to multiple contributing factors.”</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the researchers plan to dive deeper into which aspects of physical activity may be most important, for example exercise intensity and longitudinal activity patterns. They also plan to investigate the biological mechanisms linking physical activity, tau buildup, and cognitive health. Critically, the authors believe that this work may help design future clinical trials that test exercise interventions to slow late-life cognitive decline, especially in individuals who are at heightened risk due to preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.</p>



<p>“We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active,” said first author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/23351/wai-ying-yau?cmp=nwsref">Wai-Ying Wendy Yau</a>, a cognitive neurologist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. “Every step counts — and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health.”</p>

<p>Keeping the peace in the Cold War was a matter of MAD, or mutually assured destruction, with both the U.S. and Soviet Union racing to develop and amass ever more deadly weapons to keep the other at bay and maintain an uneasy status quo.</p>



<p>The problem, according to Benjamin Wilson, was the chief proponents of that early brand of arms control, an elite group of science advisers, “wore a progressive face” but ended up<strong> “</strong>protecting existing structures and domestic arrangements, foreclosing the possibility of more radical transformations.”</p>



<p>That’s the argument <a href="https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/benjamin-wilson">Wilson</a>, an associate professor of the history of science, makes in his new book, “<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674976085">Strange Stability: How Cold War Scientists Set Out to Control the Arms Race and Ended Up Serving the Military-Industrial Complex</a>.”</p>



<p>In this edited interview, Wilson discusses the doctrine of “strategic stability” and the downside of the American cultural myth of the independent scientist who saves society from itself.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-narrow-single-line"/>



<p><strong>The book takes a look at the narrative that grew up around the arms control movement. Can you describe it?</strong></p>



<p>In the 1950s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union started building these big arsenals of intercontinental bombers and ballistic missiles that could carry out devastating attacks very quickly.</p>



<p>But strategists realized that there could be a political or military crisis where tensions are extremely high, and one side gets convinced the other side might attack, so it seems prudent to attack first. Or there could be a mishap, like a blip on a radar screen that looks like an attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strategic stability is a condition where neither side would ever strike first, even if it might ordinarily be tempting to attack. Stability theory says you should put your missiles in hardened silos and submarines where the enemy can’t find them, so even if there is a crisis or an accident, both sides will know that they can retaliate even if they’re attacked first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standard narrative from the Cold War says that strategic stability was a natural and inevitable idea and was dictated by the logic of strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-b6179342-4a1a-4ef6-aca0-3ef58a475319">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Many of the arrangements that I uncovered and analyzed in my book were hidden from the public, so it could take a future historian to build an accurate understanding of whatever is going on right now.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>The second part of the narrative is about the people who discovered and promoted this idea of strategic stability. These were social and natural scientists who advised and consulted for the government. They created a new field organized around stability that they called arms control.</p>



<p>The narrative says that these arms controllers were independent thinkers whose advice to policymakers was geared toward promoting stability and peace.</p>



<p>In effect, they were a restraint on what President [Dwight] Eisenhower famously called the military-industrial complex, and they were able to serve as a restraint precisely because they were independent scientists and intellectuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>But you found that’s not the case. What’s missing from that standard story?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>What I found in researching my book was that both parts of that Cold War narrative are wrong, or at least incomplete.</p>

</div>



<p>The first part, the origins of stability, is incomplete.</p>



<p>American strategists were talking about protecting retaliatory weapons before they talked about strategic stability, so it wasn’t the case that they discovered the theory of stability and then used it to formulate concrete strategic policy.</p>



<p>It turns out that throughout the Cold War, strategists applied stability concepts in flexible and sometimes inconsistent ways, often as a justification for policies they preferred for other reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then, you can ask, what other reasons?</p>



<p>Well, it turns out those scientists were not the independent thinkers we thought they were. They were very much attached. They represented powerful institutions of the national security state, including extremely successful weapons contractors, and the interests of those institutions had a way of sculpting the kinds of stability arguments that the thinkers I studied put forward.</p>



<p>What they always argued for was more research and development to make better weapons. In the book I refer to such figures as R&amp;D elites.</p>



<p><strong>What was the alternative vision if not arms control and strategic stability?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The alternative was disarmament — getting rid of weapons, getting rid of the means of developing and making weapons.</p>



<p>Cold War scientists and arms controllers spent a huge amount of energy arguing that disarmament was unrealistic and utopian because it would be impossible to verify, and it would be destabilizing.</p>



<p>They argued you could never erase the knowledge of the nuclear age, and that under a hypothetical condition of disarmament, the first side that decided to rearm would have a big advantage, and that was destabilizing.</p>



<p>I would simply point out that that argument is also very convenient for the military research and development organizations they represented.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In the book you discuss the popular American trope of the independent scientist restraining the establishment for its own good. Why do you think that image has had such staying power culturally?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I think the myth is a consoling one. It responds to an anxiety that people feel about the state and other big institutions that shape our lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. created an enormous national security state that reached deeply into other institutions, including private corporations and universities.</p>



<p>The myth became solidified with the surge of anti-militarism around the Vietnam War. That war profoundly damaged the faith that many Americans had in the institutions that purported to guarantee their security, and I think many wanted to believe that there was someone on the inside who was trying to keep things under control, who was working to check the government’s worst impulses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Into that space arrived the image of the scientist, someone who seemed to have a kind of innate independence, who could transcend institutions and restrain them from the inside.</p>



<p>And here were these powerful and prestigious scientists claiming to be doing exactly that, and so the myth was endorsed both by these scientists and by many people on the outside who looked to them with a kind of sincere hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In what ways has this dynamic evolved from the Cold War, and in what ways has it remained the same?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Many of the arrangements that I uncovered and analyzed in my book were hidden from the public, so it could take a future historian to build an accurate understanding of whatever is going on right now.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I do have a hunch that the traditional military complex still has an important influence on policy debates today. But I suspect that in addition to missile companies, it’s Silicon Valley that’s furnishing some of the most influential R&amp;D elites.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What lesson can today’s scientists take about their role in guiding national policy and in speaking to the public?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>I have not written an advice book, and I don’t pretend to tell scientists how they should behave today.</p>



<p>But I do think my book presents a kind of cautionary tale. Here were some of the greatest and most prestigious scientists of the 20th century, and in my view, they ended up serving forces they claimed to control and even to oppose, sometimes without realizing they were doing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any advice I have applies as much to myself as anyone else: Be clear about what you value. Try to comprehend the forces that you serve and understand that they’re much larger than you.</p>



<p>And beware the temptation to believe that you are not responsible, ultimately, for the role that you play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biologists long have been fascinated by the ability of salamanders to regrow entire limbs. Now Harvard researchers have solved part of the mystery of how they accomplish this feat — by activating stem cells throughout the body, not just at the injury site.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.025">paper</a> published in the journal Cell, researchers documented how this bodywide response in axolotl salamanders is triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, or the “fight or flight” network. The study raises the possibility that these mechanisms might one day be manipulated to regenerate human limbs and organs.</p>



<p>“We’ve shown the importance of the adrenaline stress signaling hormone in getting cells ready for regeneration,” said <a href="https://hscrb.harvard.edu/people/duygu-payzin/">Duygu Payzin-Dogru</a>, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. “Because adrenaline exists in humans, this tells us we can co-opt some of the things we found in the axolotl to perhaps improve regenerative outcomes in humans. We have some of the same components and just have to figure out the right way to implement them.”</p>



<p>The new study culminates several years of research by the <a href="https://hscrb.harvard.edu/labs/whited-lab/">lab of Jessica Whited</a>, associate professor in the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, who studies limb regeneration in axolotls, a species native to Mexico. Axolotls are often examined as model organisms of limb regeneration because they are among the fastest-breeding species of salamanders.</p>



<p>Some invertebrates, such as planarian flatworms, can regrow entire bodies from small bits of tissue. But salamanders are the only vertebrates that can regenerate full limbs.</p>



<p>When an appendage is severed, salamanders sprout a blastema — a lump that contains the precursor cells that become increasingly specialized to form a new arm, leg, or tail.</p>



<p>This remarkable ability has long intrigued biologists because it may provide insights into regenerative medicine. Some researchers suspect that the ancient common ancestor of all tetrapods (the group of four-limbed vertebrates that includes amphibians, birds, and mammals) was able to regenerate limbs, but this ability was subsequently lost in most evolutionary lineages.</p>



<p>In 2018, the Whited team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160617301951?via%3Dihub">reported</a> that limb amputation triggered a proliferation of cells throughout the body — even in limbs and organs that remained unharmed — but it remained unclear what mechanisms governed this response. The team spent more than six years deciphering those processes — an investigation that ultimately involved 38 co-authors.</p>



<p>They discovered that the systematic response was coordinated by the adrenergic signaling network, part of the sympathetic nervous system that also controls involuntary responses such as heart rate, breathing, and blood flow during times of extreme stress. (This system became well-known due to the pioneering studies of Harvard physiologist <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/education-admissions/md-program/advising-academic-support/academic-societies/cannon-society">Walter Bradford Cannon</a>, who coined the term “fight or flight response” more than a century ago). Adrenergic signaling also involves the hormones noradrenaline and adrenaline, both of which also can act as neurotransmitters.</p>

</div>



<p>The systemic activation of stem cells and other progenitor cells “primes” the other uninjured limbs to regenerate more quickly — an ability that may help salamanders survive in the wild because they often lose multiple limbs to predators or cannibalism. The researchers discovered that the activated cells reconfigured their DNA architecture to make some genes easier to turn on — thus readying them for future regeneration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The animal seems to form a short-term memory of the injury, bodywide,” said Payzin-Dogru. “There is something that senses the injury and kind of goes into ‘getting ready’ mode for a subsequent injury so it can respond faster.”</p>



<p>But the priming was short-lived: The researchers found that systemic activation persisted only a few cell cycles, perhaps because the high metabolic costs could only be sustained for brief periods. After four weeks, there was no difference in the speed of limb regeneration.</p>



<p>The study parsed the roles of different elements of this system: One pathway, known as alpha-adrenergic signaling, is required to prime distant cells for limb regeneration, while another, known as beta-adrenergic signaling, promotes regrowth at the amputation site. The adrenergic signaling also triggered cascades of downstream processes essential for limb regeneration.</p>

</div>



<p>For two centuries, scientists have known that nerve supply was necessary to regenerate limbs, but many suspected the process involved sensory or motor nerves. “I heard very few people talking about sympathetic nerves,” said Whited.</p>



<p>Until now, many biologists have viewed limb regeneration as a local phenomenon at the injury site. But Whited said growing evidence suggests that it should be viewed as a whole-body event.</p>



<p>“I think it’s paradigm-shifting,” she said of the new study. “I think it’s going to inspire a lot of future work to try to figure out not just how this works in an axolotl, but also how it works in other systems.”</p>

<p>With its facade of Alaskan yellow cedar, its bird-safe glass, and its branch-like mass timber beams, the David Rubenstein Treehouse, Harvard’s first University-wide conference center, has been designed to create a unique visual experience for visitors and to facilitate collaboration and social connection.&nbsp;The building, which began hosting private events this month, will serve as the “front door” to the adjacent <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/about-us/visit-us/allston/enterprise-research-campus">Enterprise Research Campus</a> (ERC) in Allston. It was made possible by a gift from David Rubenstein, whose history of giving and service to Harvard extends over the past several decades.</p>



<p>“Since planning began on the ERC, one of our primary goals was to create a convening space at the University that would serve not only as a hub for sharing and innovating across disciplines but also for wider collaboration among academic, industry, and public and community leaders,” said Harvard Executive Vice President Meredith Weenick. “The Rubenstein Treehouse will provide space for exciting convenings and it will facilitate partnerships and foster connections.”</p>

<p>The building’s proximity to both Harvard Business School and Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex supports its role as a convening space, and its design features are intended to facilitate collaboration and connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Conference facilities are often closed-off spaces that lack connections to the communities and environment around them, but this building is designed to be different,” said the building’s design architect, Jeanne Gang, M.Arch. ’93, founding partner of Studio Gang and Kajima Professor in Practice of Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. “The idea was to create a place that felt more open and welcoming to everyone. Our design features visual connections across levels, so people can see each other and feel part of the activity happening throughout the building. Lots of natural light and framed views of the surrounding campus also help create a pleasant and unique experience for visitors.”</p>



<p>According to Gang, the building’s treehouse-like design is critical to the visitor experience.&nbsp; “We wanted visitors to feel the wonder and excitement of climbing up into a treehouse,” she said. The mass timber beams form branching structures that expand outward through the building’s three floors, culminating with the main 600-person conference room, called Canopy Hall, on the top floor.</p>

<p>The Rubenstein Treehouse is Harvard’s first mass timber building, an important factor in making it the University’s most sustainable structure.</p>



<p>“The David Rubenstein Treehouse is a model for the University’s leading-edge, multi-faceted approach to sustainability on campus,” Weenick said. “The mass timber construction makes the building visually stunning and creates a warm, welcoming, and memorable environment for visitors from near and far.”</p>



<p>The choice of mass timber over steel significantly reduces the building’s embodied carbon. Other key features include concrete made with ground glass pozzolan as an additive, rather than the commonly used coal fly ash, and interior fabrics and finishes that meet Harvard Healthier Building Academy guidelines for avoiding chemicals of concern in the supply chain, such as PFAS. Sustainability and overall environmental health were at the forefront of decision-making throughout the construction process. In some cases, the design and sustainability goals worked synergistically, as in the case of the in-floor ventilation system.</p>



<p>“We wanted to make sure the mass timber beams and columns were not obstructed by ducting and other building systems, so we moved most of those components under the floor,” said Gang. Not only did that create clean lines and an improved visual experience, it enabled the installation of a floor-based ventilation system that provides 75 percent more fresh air than standard HVAC and boosts energy efficiency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Rubenstein Treehouse is <a href="https://rubensteintreehouse.harvard.edu/inquire">now open for private scheduled events</a>. The first floor, with a cafe in the atrium, is expected to open to the public in January. Other elements of the ERC, including the Atlas Hotel and laboratory spaces, are expected to open in early 2026 as well, according to developer Tishman Speyer.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Alongside painkillers, food, and technology, one psychiatrist worries about the addictive potential of getting back at people — or even thinking about it.</p>



<p>James Kimmel knows the danger well.</p>



<p>Now a psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine, he once was moments from being a teenage murderer. In a lecture given Wednesday, Kimmel explained how he wielded a loaded gun against school bullies after years of worsening torment —&nbsp;and why he didn’t fire.</p>



<p>“At the last second, I had this split second of insight,” Kimmel told his audience at the remote Community Conversations event hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Design. “If I went ahead with this, I’d have, for the rest of my life, to identify as a murderer — and that was not an identity that was acceptable to me.”</p>



<p>It was just enough time to break the spell of “sweet revenge” —&nbsp;a psychological phenomenon that, Kimmel argued, works very much like any other drug.</p>



<p>When people are harboring a grievance, no matter its validity, Kimmel said, “It’s a very real pain. And your brain really, really doesn’t want pain —&nbsp;and so it instantly scrambles to rebalance that pain with pleasure.”</p>



<p>Decades of functional MRI data show the result: As subjects fantasize about settling scores, the brain’s reward and pleasure centers flood with dopamine — just as they would from gambling or tobacco.</p>



<p>And, just as with gambling or tobacco, the high doesn’t last. “It spurs us to go further, fantasize even more heavily, or go and take a physical act of revenge —&nbsp;to get that hit again and again,” Kimmel said.</p>



<p>Viewed from outside, the psychological cycle of resentment and revenge has an obvious grim futility. And yet in population studies, almost 100 percent of subjects will confess to having had at least one revenge fantasy in their lives.</p>



<p>“It’s thought to be part of an adaptive strategy from the Ice Age: to stop people from stealing your mate, stealing the food you need for the coming winter,” Kimmel said. “But now, of course, we seek revenge for threats that are just to our egos, that don’t have life-or-death consequences.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)"><blockquote><p>If revenge is a cheap thrill, Kimmel argued, “Forgiveness is something of a wonder drug.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Kimmel argued that the ancient brain chemistry lies at the root of most contemporary conflict, from ongoing wars and rancorous political divisions to social media spats.</p>



<p>What has changed, he said, is the technology: Notably, algorithms that have learned to exploit the druglike potential of contesting with an enemy.</p>



<p>“Now, when political leaders express a grievance, they can instantly ‘infect’ millions of people with that same grievance,” Kimmel said.</p>



<p>Online platforms don’t just act as vectors for rapid spread. They also offer a means of instant relief: to “fire back” violent or cruel rhetoric at the perceived enemy.</p>



<p>For that reason, Kimmel believes those algorithms should be regulated just as if they were herbicides or pesticides —&nbsp;hazardous to human health.</p>



<p>But he does also see avenues for hope.</p>



<p>Looking back at his harrowing teenage experience, Kimmel sees that moment of insight as having given his prefrontal cortex —&nbsp;momentarily swamped by the operation of rage in other parts of the brain —&nbsp;a chance to recover and do its protective work.</p>



<p>And near-misses are common: While revenge fantasies are nearly universal experiences, only about one in five say they have acted on those fantasies.</p>



<p>What’s more, once we come to see revenge in his terms, Kimmel said, we gain tools against it: namely, cognitive-behavioral therapy, peer-support programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, and —&nbsp;potentially —&nbsp;GLP-1 drugs that have shown promise in <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/10/dry-january-helped-drive-drinking-rates-to-96-year-low/">reducing other kinds of cravings</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Revenge-Understanding-Deadliest-Addiction/dp/0593796519/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3R0VE1S8M8VMB&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jG7Gsqs1yr2sv4sA_nTGQg.r6W20rZ85FjPOEt4QOdoeurFSzcJdxNI759wABO9o5Y&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=kimmel+science+of+revenge&amp;qid=1726254825&amp;sprefix=kimmel+science+of+revenge%2Caps%2C70&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> published this spring and a <a href="https://www.miraclecourt.com">free app</a>, Kimmel offers his own intervention: a kind of imaginary courtroom where perceived wrongs can be considered, judged, and —&nbsp;eventually —&nbsp;released.</p>



<p>If revenge is a cheap thrill, Kimmel argued, “Forgiveness is something of a wonder drug.” The same brain scans show that after a harm, forgiveness “actually deactivates the anterior insula, the pain network inside your head. So instead of covering it up with a dopamine rush, you’re actually getting pain <em>stoppage</em>.”</p>



<p>Easier said than done, of course. Kimmel calls his imaginary courtroom the “non-justice system” for a reason&nbsp;— it aims not to settle accounts but to offer liberation from a destructive pattern.</p>



<p>After hearing both sides and weighing a sentence, “In the final judgment, you’re given an opportunity to <em>imagine</em> what it would feel like if you decided to forgive — you don’t even have to commit” to going that route, Kimmel said.</p>



<p>Even at the notion of breaking the cycle, Kimmel said, participants report they feel an instantaneous sense of relief — evidence that, despite its pleasures, “revenge-seeking is hard work.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Both A.D. Weaver and Tyler Fauntleroy remember exactly where they were in 2015, the first time they heard the “Hamilton” soundtrack.</p>



<p>Weaver was working a shift at Best Buy. He wasn’t supposed to be listening to music on the sales floor, but he’d snuck a headphone into one ear instead of his work-issued walkie-talkie. Fauntleroy was in his college dorm. By the time the soundtrack got to “Helpless,” the love song in the first act, he was lying down, completely floored.</p>



<p>“I remember ‘My Shot’ had me like, ‘OK, this is something else,’” Fauntleroy told a group of students over a campus lunch on Tuesday. “By ‘Wait for It’ I just was like, ‘I have surrendered to this album.’ It was one of those times where you’re like, ‘I’m engaging with something that’s going to change my life.’”</p>



<p>Weaver now plays George Washington and Fauntleroy plays Alexander Hamilton in the <a href="https://hamiltonmusical.com/us-tour/">North American touring cast of “Hamilton</a>.” They were joined by fellow actors Marja Harmon (Angelica Schuyler), Lauren Mariasoosay (Eliza Hamilton), and Christian Magby (Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette) at the <a href="https://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/artsbites">ArtsBites Luncheon</a> hosted by the <a href="https://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/">Office for the Arts at Harvard</a>.<br></p>

</div></figure>



<p>The cast members told students about their journeys from being fans of the musical to getting the offer to play in it. For Fauntleroy, who first auditioned in 2015 and was cast in 2023, playing Hamilton feels like a hard-won victory.</p>



<p>“It was a long, long, long road of ‘You did everything great, nothing you could do differently,’” Fauntleroy told students, describing the audition process. “For whatever reason, they go the way that they go. Now there’s something about [performing] the end of ‘Yorktown’ and seeing the feeling of victory wash over all of us. The awe of, ‘Oh, my God, we’re here. We did it.’”</p>



<p>The cast of the Tony-award winning musical has been performing at the Citizens Opera House since September as part of the 25/26 Broadway in Boston Season.&nbsp; Their last local show is Nov. 2.</p>



<p>Earlier in the day, the actors visited <a href="https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton">Houghton Library</a>, where they were welcomed by <a href="https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/drew-faust">Drew Gilpin Faust</a>, president emerita and Arthur Kingsley Porter University Research Professor.</p>



<p>“It really matters so much that you all are carrying on the tradition and that you’re here to see some of the original materials on which the whole story is based and have been passed down to our generation of Americans,” Faust said. “Thank you for bringing these ideas and these principles to wider audiences, because we need desperately to understand where we come from and who we are, and what our values are as a nation.”</p>



<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton">Houghton Library</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/staff/john-overholt">John Overholt</a>, curator of the&nbsp;<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/collections/donald-and-mary-hyde-collection-dr-samuel-johnson">Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson</a>&nbsp;and Early Books and Manuscripts, showed the cast an array of rare documents dating back to the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Among them were an original Boston printing of the Declaration of Independence, a first edition of the Federalist Papers, and a “Reynolds Pamphlet.” Hamilton wrote the pamphlet, which figures famously in the musical, to defend himself from embezzlement accusations by confessing to an extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds, whose husband was a blackmailer and scam artist.</p>



<p>The actors clustered around the document<strong>,</strong> turning its 250-year-old cotton fiber pages and scanning the text. “And he wrote it down right there,” Magby exclaimed, quoting from the musical.</p>



<p>The cast took turns reading aloud an English translation of a Latin honorary degree — the first Harvard ever bestowed — presented to George Washington in 1776.</p>



<p>Faust and Marc Goodheart, vice president and senior adviser to the president and provost, led the cast members on a tour of some of the historic sites in Harvard Yard, including Massachusetts Hall, which once housed founding fathers Samuel Adams, John Adams, John Hancock, and Elbridge Gerry as students, as well as Hollis Hall and Holden Chapel, which (like Mass Hall) housed Continental Army soldiers during the Revolutionary War. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Office for the Arts, the cast answered student questions about favorite moments from the show, navigating an uncertain theater job market, and representation.</p>



<p>Harmon recalled the first time she saw actress Renée Goldsberry playing Hamilton’s sister-in-law Angelica Schuyler and thinking, “This is the first time I’ve ever seen myself on stage, represented,” Harmon said.</p>



<p>“What auditioning looked like pre-‘Hamilton’ and what it looks like now, even though it still has a long way to go, it’s night and day,” she said. “The difference is the opportunity and trusting that brown and Black people can lead shows and be successful.”</p>



<p>Each cast member shared a different approach to handling the stress of nightly shows on tour. Weaver said getting enough sleep is key. Fauntleroy said sitting in silence for at least 15 minutes every day helps him handle some of the fast-paced show’s more exhausting numbers, including “My Shot,” which he said feels like a “flash grenade.”</p>

<p>“The show is just super stimulating. You have to pace your brain throughout the day,” Fauntleroy said. “I’ve learned if I’ve already overstimulated myself during the day, of course it’s gonna be crazy, it’s gonna feel more intense than it is. If I’ve grounded myself then I have even more to give and more places to go.”</p>



<p>At the historic Wadsworth House, the cast were delighted by a surprise a capella performance of “Wait for It,” by the <a href="https://www.harvardopportunes.com/">Harvard Opportunes</a>.</p>



<p>“I think for lot of us — at least for me at 14 — our lives were changed by ‘Hamilton,’” Opportunes soprano Gabby Medina ’26 told the cast as they hugged and posed for photos after the performance.&nbsp;“We don’t really get to sing a lot of musical theater like this, so this is really healing.”</p>



<p>“It’s healing for us too,” Mariasoosay said.</p>

<p>Children born to mothers who had COVID-19 while pregnant face an elevated risk of developmental disorders by the time they turn 3 years old, including speech delays, autism, motor disorders, and other developmental delays, according to new research by investigators at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/">Mass General Brigham</a>. The findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="http://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000006112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</a>.</p>



<p>“These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” said senior author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/obgyn/vcrb/research/edlow-lab?cmp=nwsref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea Edlow</a>, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in the&nbsp;Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology&nbsp;at Mass General Brigham. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines — including the COVID-19 vaccine — is being eroded.”</p>

<p>“These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development.” </p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>Other maternal infections during pregnancy have been linked to risk for a range of neurodevelopmental diseases during childhood, and animal studies have shown that immune activation during pregnancy disrupts normal fetal brain development and offspring behavior. To assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, investigators analyzed data on 18,124 live births at Mass General Brigham within the peak COVID-19 window of March 2020 to May 2021.</p>



<p>The investigators studied 18,124 mother-child pairs. Among the 861 children whose mothers were SARS-CoV-2–positive during pregnancy, 140 (16.3 percent) received a neurodevelopmental diagnosis by age 3, compared with 1,680 (9.7 percent) of the 17,263 remaining children from SARS-CoV-2–negative pregnancies. After adjusting for other influencing factors, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was associated with 29 percent higher odds of a neurodevelopmental condition in children.</p>



<p>The investigators also found that males were at higher risk than females. Risk was greatest when infection occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p>



<p>While reducing risk is important, co-senior author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17173/roy-perlis?cmp=nwsref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roy Perlis</a> of the Mass General Brigham&nbsp;Department of Psychiatry noted, “The overall risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in exposed children likely remains low.”</p>



<p>First author and maternal-fetal medicine specialist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/22603/lydia-shook?cmp=nwsref" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lydia Shook</a> added, “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fas.harvard.edu/about-dean-hoekstra">Hopi Hoekstra</a> has led the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) through a period of tremendous challenge and change. Now in her third year as dean, the questions she faces are more complex than ever. But she proceeds with a clear sense of purpose and strong collaborators.</p>



<p>“Leadership is a team sport,” said Hoekstra, Edgerley Family Dean of the FAS. “In the FAS we have been working on big issues, from the state of discourse on our campus to academic rigor to real financial challenges. These aren’t problems that any one person can solve. It’s about working together and rowing in the same direction.”</p>



<p>It’s a leadership style the evolutionary geneticist, who also holds the titles of C.Y. Chan Professor of Arts and Sciences and Xiaomeng Tong and Yu Chen Professor of Life Sciences, honed in the science lab.</p>



<p>“I built my lab by bringing together people with diverse academic backgrounds in neurobiology, genetics, development, and computational biology,” Hoekstra said. “Because we all brought different perspectives and expertise, we could tackle what I saw as some of the big unanswered questions in biology.”</p>



<p>In an interview with the Gazette, which has been edited for clarity and length, Hoekstra spoke about finding opportunity in adversity and her empirical, faculty-led approach to leadership and problem-solving. She also reflected on her top priorities for the year.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-narrow-single-line"/>



<p><strong>What did you learn during your first two years as FAS dean that has shaped how you are leading?</strong></p>



<p>Excellence — in our teaching, in our research, in the intellectual life of our community — is who we are. But it doesn’t sustain itself automatically. Over the last two years, we’ve had to look squarely at the pressures that put that excellence at risk — from the evolving regulatory environment to our longstanding and widening structural financial deficit in the FAS.</p>



<p>My focus as dean has been to face those challenges head-on — not just to understand them, but to turn them into an opportunity to ask who we want to be as a faculty, and what it will take to get there. That means aligning our ambitions with our resources, setting priorities we can stand behind, and holding fast to the principles that define us. Even when it’s hard.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote alignwide is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;My focus as dean has been to face those challenges head-on — not just to understand them, but to turn them into an opportunity to ask who we want to be as a faculty, and what it will take to get there.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a scientist, I know to surround myself with expert collaborators. I know about the power of bringing data to bear on big challenges and big decisions. I am grounding our work in the collective wisdom of our community.</p>



<p>This is a challenging time, but also a clarifying one. There will never be a better time than now to take on this important work. And if we can be open to change, willing to try new approaches and to trust each other, I believe we’ll emerge stronger and more focused on our core mission than ever.</p>



<p><strong>You have made preserving the FAS’s research excellence and funding an urgent priority. As a biologist whose lab lost federal funding, can you talk about how you are approaching this work?</strong></p>



<p>I understand first-hand how even brief pauses in funding can have ripple effects. That is why I assembled <a href="https://officeofthesecretary.fas.harvard.edu/ad-hoc-committees?utm_source=Unknown+List&amp;utm_campaign=658f28dc67-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_05_16_11_58&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-658f28dc67-">a “blue ribbon” committee</a> of faculty whose work also relies on federal funding. Their expertise spans the sciences and social sciences, and I asked them not to advocate for their own departments and disciplines but to think about how we can best sustain research continuity across the FAS.</p>



<p>The Research Continuity Committee has been instrumental in outlining principles, prioritizing funding opportunities, and making solid recommendations to me that I have implemented in the FAS.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, I’ve asked them to think boldly about new funding models for Harvard scientists, approaches that encourage innovation and risk-taking. This moment calls for exactly that kind of boldness and creativity.</p>



<p><strong>What do you use as your north star in this uncertain financial moment?</strong></p>



<p>I often think back to when I was considering joining Harvard almost 20 years ago. What struck me was the sense of boundless possibility; it felt like a place where I would be limited by only my curiosity and imagination. We must preserve that spirit by continuing to recruit the very best faculty and students, and by creating an environment where the next generation can do their best work. Our academic mission demands it.</p>



<p>This can only happen when colleagues are empowered as true partners in problem-solving. I think of the faculty leading major FAS initiatives, for example, on civil discourse and generative AI. I think of our new Council of Chairs and Council of Center Directors, which bring together faculty leaders to share ideas and learn from one another. And I think of our divisional deans and the SEAS dean, who are invaluable thought partners as we make tough decisions and set ambitious goals.</p>



<p><strong>You’ve pursued several interventions to build financial capacity for the FAS. Can you talk about these efforts?</strong></p>



<p>The FAS’s financial landscape is complex. The recent reinstatement of federal grants is certainly welcome, but it doesn’t meaningfully ease our broader financial constraints in the short term.</p>



<p>Our structural deficit predates recent disruptions and has only deepened over time. Add that to the 6.5-fold increase in the endowment tax, which will hit the FAS particularly hard.</p>



<p>This leaves us with very little margin for flexibility. That is why we’re making structural changes now to ensure that we have the capacity and agility to safeguard and invest in our academic priorities.</p>



<p>Let me provide two examples.</p>



<p>First is the <a href="https://officeofthesecretary.fas.harvard.edu/ad-hoc-committees">Taskforce on Workforce Planning</a>, which is identifying ways to build financial capacity in our administrative operations and, at the same time, to work more effectively and efficiently in service to our faculty and students.</p>



<p>Second, I reconstituted the <a href="https://officeofthesecretary.fas.harvard.edu/ad-hoc-committees">Faculty Resources Committee</a>, which is providing faculty-led guidance on how to preserve and strengthen our core academic mission over the long term. Both groups have worked diligently through the summer and early fall and will share their early findings in the coming weeks.</p>



<p><strong>You have made some big moves in undergraduate admissions, including </strong><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/04/harvard-announces-return-to-required-testing/"><strong>reinstating standardized testing requirements</strong></a><strong> and most recently, </strong><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/03/harvard-expands-financial-aid/"><strong>significantly expanding financial aid</strong></a><strong>. What drove these decisions, and why are they important? </strong></p>



<p>When I think about admissions, two priorities guide me: excellence and opportunity.</p>



<p>On the excellence side, reinstating standardized tests gives us another piece of information about an applicant.&nbsp;When we consider scores in the context of a student’s background and circumstances, they can help us identify talent and potential that might otherwise be missed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to opportunity, our commitment to access couldn’t be stronger. For the Class of 2029, 45 percent of students are not paying tuition, and for half of them, their entire Harvard education will be free. Expanding financial aid ensures that cost is never a barrier for exceptional students from any background.</p>



<p><strong>Recentering academics for students has been a priority from the start of your deanship. What does this mean to you, and how are you pursuing it?</strong></p>



<p>At my very first faculty meeting as FAS dean, we had a lively discussion about a report on grade inflation led by Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh. The report highlighted a drift away from the classroom as the center of the undergraduate experience — correlated with grade inflation, reduced attendance, and less preparation and active engagement.</p>



<p>In response, I approached this work by bringing together a team. The <a href="https://www.fas.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum716/files/2025-04/CSCC-FINAL_Adopted-03.04.25-FINAL-ua_0.pdf">Classroom Social Compact Committee</a> used data to quantify these trends and developed recommendations that are now being implemented by a network of partners in <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/">Harvard College</a>, the <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/">Bok Center for Teaching and Learning</a>, and the <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/">Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</a> to reinvigorate the classroom experience.</p>



<p>As faculty, we have a real responsibility to make our classrooms spaces of curiosity, challenge, and open exchange, places that students don’t want to miss, where they wrestle with ideas that shape them as thinkers and leaders long after Harvard. I am optimistic, as we are already seeing strong faculty engagement and positive momentum.</p>



<p><strong>You’ve met with thousands of members of the Harvard community by now. What are some of moments that have stayed with you?</strong></p>



<p>About a year ago, I began hosting small lunches with faculty from across the FAS. Each gathering brings together about eight colleagues — almost always from all three academic divisions and SEAS — with no set agenda other than getting to know one another and sharing our work.</p>



<p>It’s a simple but powerful reminder of why we all are here: to learn from one another. I’ve seen new collaborations spark right at the table. One recent example: At one of these lunches, an environmental historian met an astronomer from the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/">Center for Astrophysics</a>, and now they’re launching a new interdisciplinary project together.</p>



<p>Creating space to make these connections has been nothing short of inspiring. It’s a reminder of what unites us as a faculty and why the FAS is such an extraordinary community.</p>

<p>Understanding how cells turn genes on and off is one of biology’s most enduring mysteries.</p>



<p>Now, a new technology developed by <a>chemist Brian Liau </a>and his collaborators at Harvard offers an unprecedented window into this activity, an advance that has the potential to transform our understanding of the basic science as well as the treatment of genetic diseases.</p>



<p>In a paper recently published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02811-2">Nature Methods</a>, the authors unveiled a powerful genome mapping tool that reveals how tiny changes in DNA can reshape the way genes are controlled. This new platform, called TDAC-seq (Targeted Deaminase Accessible Chromatin sequencing), allows researchers to see, at single-nucleotide resolution, how hundreds of genetic perturbations alter the structure of “chromatin” — the dynamic DNA packaging that determines which genes are accessible to the cell’s machinery.</p>

</div>



<p>Previously, scientists mostly focused on the tiny portion of DNA that directly creates proteins. Now, TDAC-seq helps them finally study the “dark matter&#8221; of our genetic code — the noncoding DNA, which makes up about 98 percent of the genome and helps regulate gene activity.</p>



<p>“This new and innovative method is a tour de force, offering an unprecedented view into the DNA elements that govern our genome,” said David Liu, Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences, whose earlier work on base-editing enzymes helped make this technology possible. “This work will not only speed up our basic understanding of how these switches work but also show us how they could be targeted to benefit patients in the future.”</p>



<p>This research was performed by members of Liau’s lab, including Heejin Roh and Simon Shen, Ph.D. students in the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Hui Si Kwok, a postdoctoral scholar. The group collaborated with <a href="https://hscrb.harvard.edu/people/jason-buenrostro/">Jason D. Buenrostro</a>, professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, and his former graduate student Yan Hu, who helped with computational analysis.</p>



<p>The researchers began with a big question: Can we find a way to test hundreds of changes to genetic switches at once and measure their effects in real cells?</p>



<p>“We wanted to develop a strategy where we can systematically mutate these noncoding elements using CRISPR to figure out how they work,” Liau said. “The problem was that we didn’t have the tools to do it, so we had to invent them.”</p>

</div>



<p>The Liau Lab’s innovation centered on an enzyme called DddA, found in bacteria, which marks open DNA by converting a single base, cytosine, into thymine — without breaking the DNA strand. By layering these DddA-induced mutations on top of CRISPR-edited DNA, the team developed a new way to read DNA accessibility in cells after CRISPR-genome editing.</p>



<p>“When we started the project, DddA was new and very little was known about it, so boosting its mutation rate in the genome was a big challenge,” Roh said. “We tried different DddA variants and optimized the reaction conditions until we achieved a mutation rate high enough to measure chromatin accessibility at single-molecule resolution.”</p>



<p>Shen, who helped handle the massive amounts of data the new technique generated, noted that innovation was a key to their success.</p>



<p>“Because this is a fundamentally new kind of data set that we’re collecting, it required a fundamentally new way to analyze the data,” Shen said. “Our approach was really good for getting us long, high-coverage reads in the targeted regions and pinpointing key elements within noncoding DNA.”</p>



<p>To demonstrate the power of their tool, the scientists applied it to several regulatory regions, including one that controls fetal hemoglobin — a hotbed for genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease.</p>



<p>By engineering DNA variants in human blood stem cells and applying TDAC-seq, the team tracked exactly how each change affected the surrounding chromatin. Buenrostro, a pioneer in technologies used to map chromatin accessibility, provided invaluable input enabling the team’s success.</p>

</div>



<p>“We were able to increase the fetal globin through genome editing, which is the therapeutic strategy to treat sickle cell disease, and then measure the resulting changes in chromatin accessibility to get at the underlying molecular mechanism.” Roh said. “We also showed that this method can be applied to pooled CRISPR screens in primary cells, unlike other existing long-read sequencing methods.”</p>



<p>TDAC-seq’s importance goes well beyond sickle cell disease. Liau envisions the platform being used in the future to screen potential gene therapy strategies, guide the design of more precise treatments, and even help explain mysterious links between DNA variations and disease risks.</p>



<p>“This can be very impactful because most disease-associated variants are in noncoding regions of the genome,” Liau said, who plans to hone TDAC-seq so it works in even more cell types and situations. “This tool is generalizable, so you can use it to study any kind of switch or a gene that is altered by disease.”</p>

<p>This research was supported by a NIH Maximizing Investigators&#8217; Research Award (MIRA).</p>

<p><em>Excerpted from “The Zorg: A Tale&nbsp;of Greed and Murder That Inspired the Abolition of Slavery” by Siddharth Kara, Harvard Kennedy School fellow, ’13, ’16-18, T.H. Chan School of Public Health fellow, ’12-&#8217;24</em></p>

<p>Newly appointed captain Robert Stubbs had wagered that he could reach Jamaica in time. The stakes included the lives of everyone on board the Zorg, the profit of the venture, and the futures of men like the incapacitated captain and physician Luke Collingwood, deposed navigator James Kelsall, and Stubbs himself. Stubbs prudently followed the strong northwest trade winds toward his destination. Laughing gulls and tricolored herons accompanied the ship as it glided over the balmy Caribbean waters.</p>



<p>Two or three days past Tobago, “on or about the twentieth or twenty first of November,” someone on board the Zorg made a surprising discovery. Perhaps one of the Dutch crew members who was used to a more methodical monitoring of provisions under the printed instructions provided by the MCC, the Dutch slave-trade enterprise, to former captain Jan Wilton finally decided to conduct his own examination of the ship’s supplies. Or, like so many other incidents that impacted the Zorg’s journey, it may have just been a random event. Whoever it was, one of the sailors on board the Zorg uncovered that the previous check of the water supply made back near Tobago had been inaccurate.</p>



<p>At some point during the journey, perhaps during a bout of violent weather, “a large quantity of the water had leaked from the lower tier of water casks.” Were these the casks that had been loaded back in Accra when the cooper was ill, and if so, were they not properly trimmed and prepared by the native coopers? Or did they just get damaged at some point along the way? Upon the discovery, the crew conducted a more careful survey of the water supplies, which revealed that there were only “twenty butts of water remaining.”</p>



<p>Twenty butts amounted to about 2,400 gallons of water. Assuming the same consumption rate of 0.5 gallons of water per person per day and 392 people on board (380 slaves + 11 crew + 1 Robert Stubbs; baby of enslaved mother Sia would be nursing), the ship had a 12-day supply of water on board. Given that the Zorg should have been no more than seven or eight days from its destination, the crew could feel confident that they had “a sufficient quantity” of water “to last the voyage to Jamaica.” The discovery of the water leakage was a surprise, but not a catastrophic one.</p>



<p>Prudence dictated an obvious step. Any experienced captain would&nbsp;have taken it. Robert Stubbs should have ordered everyone on board put on a “short allowance” of water. In the event the journey to Jamaica took longer than anticipated or there was some other leakage or loss of water, ordering the crew and Africans to one-half or one-third water allowance would extend the duration of the Zorg’s water supply while maximizing survival rates. Everyone on board would be thirsty, but they would survive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert Stubbs took no such step. If Collingwood or Kelsall suggested it, he didn’t listen. The crew of the Zorg had failed to check water supplies even once during the journey. When they finally happened to notice a leakage, no one did anything about it. The Zorg sailed into the heart of the Caribbean Sea with no land in any direction for hundreds of miles. Day after day of nothing but blue. The ship’s routines almost certainly broke down. There would be no more washing of slaves, emptying of buckets, or adequate time on deck for fresh air. The ship would have been in a state of distress. The sickly, exhausted crew were doing just enough to survive. Collingwood remained incapacitated to the point of lunacy. Kelsall remained confined to quarters. Scurvy and dysentery ravaged the ship. Stubbs drove the vessel onward in a desperate bid to reach Jamaica in time.</p>



<p>On November 27, 1781, with only a few days of water remaining, the Zorg finally spotted land. The ship had traveled nine days since Tobago. It had to be Jamaica, but they needed to be sure. The only other possibility was the adjacent island of Hispaniola, which consisted of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti) and the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo (modern-day Dominican Republic). The Zorg faced the same dilemma as it did near Tobago. If they landed in enemy territory, the journey would be a financial failure, and the crew might be detained. They had come too far to take the risk now.</p>



<p>To determine which island they had spotted required a measurement of longitude by dead reckoning. Ideally, Stubbs had been taking longitude measurements every six hours since the ship passed Tobago. It is possible that a delusional Luke Collingwood had been crawling out of his cabin to take the readings, although it is unlikely. Given the enormity of the stakes, he would have relied on abler navigators to take the readings, or at least double-checked his readings with them, especially given how unwell he was. Collingwood was as desperate as anyone to reach land, as he would have been anxious to return home to his family. Out of his own survival instinct, Kelsall would have taken the readings had he been asked to do so, but he remained confined to quarters. The only other person on board with sufficient navigational experience to take the readings, a man who had captained more than one ship across the Atlantic, was Robert Stubbs.</p>



<p>It was most likely Robert Stubbs who dropped the knotted rope and log into the Caribbean Sea on November 27, 1781, to take the longitude reading. He either backtracked this single reading for the entire course since Tobago, or he added it to whatever readings he might have been taking since Tobago. Either way, the reading came back as “74 degrees west,” which placed the ship near the southwest corner of the island of Hispaniola. Latitude put the Zorg as “south nine leagues” (27 miles) from the island. The positional readings indicated that Jamaica was one more day to the west.</p>



<p>The Zorg sailed west. One day later, Jamaica was not to be found. After a second day of sailing, Stubbs sent a sailor up the ratlines, but he was “not able to see land from the foretopmast head.” The longitude reading by dead reckoning had been dead wrong. They had not been south of Hispaniola at all but of their intended destination of Jamaica and that, too, the western edge of the island. Had the reading been accurate, the Zorg could have docked safely in Kingston or whichever port was closest. Instead, the “strong currents which drove [the Zorg] with great rapidity” for two days meant that on November 29, 1781, the Zorg was “distant from Jamaica about three hundred thirty miles.”</p>



<p>To reach Jamaica, the Zorg would have to turn back and sail into the prevailing trade winds. At an optimistic pace of thirty to thirty-five miles a day, which would require expert use of the lateen sail, it would take the Zorg about ten days to reach Jamaica. However, the “few white people … on board were weak and sickly and unable to work the said vessel.” Even worse, the ship was down to “five and a half Dutch butts of water,” which was at most a four-day supply. There was one other option. Cuba was just a day or two to the north. It was a Spanish territory, so landing there once again risked seizure of the vessel, but at least everyone would survive.</p>



<p>Robert Stubbs had brought the Zorg to the precipice of disaster. He chose not to stop in Tobago to replenish provisions. He failed to put the ship on short allowance once the water leakage had been discovered. He almost certainly botched the longitude reading. As a result, the Zorg was hundreds of miles off course with only a few days of water left. The only man who could have avoided these errors had been confined to quarters the entire time.</p>



<p>The final and most definitive evidence that James Kelsall was the ablest navigator aboard the Zorg, that he had been the primary man at the wheel since the ship departed the Cape Coast roads, and that he had not been consulted on the longitude reading, is that on November 29, 1781, Kelsall was “restored … to his former station of chief mate and he accordingly then took charge of the vessel again in that capacity.” During the fifteen days that Kelsall had been suspended from duty, everything that could possibly go wrong did. The decision by Collingwood to suspend him, and whatever influence Stubbs had on the decision, had been a monumental mistake. One can only imagine the conversation, in which a repentant Collingwood and Stubbs pleaded with Kelsall to save them.</p>



<p>Although James Kelsall was back on duty and able to steer the Zorg to its destination, the fact remained that the ship was ten days west of Jamaica with only four days of water left. A decision had to be made.</p>



<p>On the evening of November 29, 1781, the surviving crew of the Zorg gathered on the quarterdeck to discuss “how to act in that situation considering the small stock of water they had left.” A proposal was made, precisely by whom will never be known. This much, however, is for certain — following a discussion on the quarterdeck, “it was then determined by the general voice of the crew that part of the slaves should be destroyed to save the rest, and the remainder of the slaves and crew put on short allowance to save them from perishing.”</p>



<p>To save themselves, the crew of the Zorg chose murder.</p>

<p>It’s time to change our minds about our brains.</p>



<p>That was the key message neuroscientist <a href="https://www.nicolecrust.com/nicole">Nicole Rust</a> brought to the Science Center on Tuesday on reframing the pursuit of cures for conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, depression, and schizophrenia.</p>



<p>“We’ve been thinking about the brain in the wrong way, insofar as we’ve been oversimplifying it,” said Rust, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who was on campus to &nbsp;discuss her new book, “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691243054/elusive-cures">Elusive Cures: Why Neuroscience Hasn’t Solved Brain Disorders — and How We Can Change That</a>.”</p>



<p>In her talk, Rust recounted how researchers spent decades envisioning brain disorders in terms of linear causes and effects — what she called “domino chains” of faulty genes to neuroanatomy to dysfunction. Their goal was simply to “find the broken domino and fix it.”</p>



<p>As a result, researchers spent their time looking for single genes and magic-bullet cures, making precious few breakthroughs. Many current medications were first developed in the mid-20th century. And they remain the state of the art because few better alternatives have come along in the intervening years despite billions spent on research.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, researchers identified a genetic mutation associated with Alzheimer’s disease and its signature symptom, the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Scientists raced to develop amyloid-clearing drugs, but those turned out to have only modest benefits (and harmful side effects), and the disease remains uncured.</p>



<p>By the second decade of this century, many researchers and funding agencies were voicing their frustration with the pace of advance.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-2674da2d-1056-47ea-ba03-8aca6f79ddaf">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The story I want to tell you is ultimately optimistic because I really do think that we are on the cusp of some amazing breakthroughs following new developments in artificial intelligence and biotechnology.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>Rust quoted Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institutes of Mental Health, who lamented that during his 13-year tenure the agency funded $20 billion in research and made many exciting discoveries, yet somehow all that yielded few improvements for patients.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing hospitalizations, or improving recovery for the tens of millions of people who have mental illness,” said Insel.</p>



<p>But now, Rust noted, modern neuroscience is re-envisioning its approach, moving “toward thinking about the brain as a complex adaptive system.”</p>



<p>Disorders such as schizophrenia are not products of single genes but hundreds of genetic variants. Moreover, many of these variations regulate other genes, adding more layers of intricacy.</p>



<p>Even when accounting for all the genetic mutations, researchers remain unable to predict which people will develop disorders and which will not. As Rust wrote, “If we want brain research to be impactful, we must stop dreaming of magic bullets and embrace complexity.”</p>



<p>“These dynamic systems are infamously hard to control in meaningful ways,” he told the audience. “Case in point: We cannot control the weather.”</p>



<p>Luckily, these realizations are dawning just as we are developing powerful new tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>



<p>For example, AlphaFold, an AI system developed by Google DeepMind, solved one of the most complex issues in biology: the “protein folding problem.” Essentially, the program was able to predict the 3D structure of nearly every known protein, based on amino acid sequences.</p>



<p>Such successes provide hope for similar breakthroughs in brain disorders.</p>



<p>Now, Rust believes, science is ready to understand the brain as a dynamic, adaptive, self-regulating system, and make real progress in deciphering our most enigmatic organ.</p>



<p>“The story I want to tell you is ultimately optimistic,” she said, “because I really do think that we are on the cusp of some amazing breakthroughs following new developments in artificial intelligence and biotechnology.”</p>



<p>Rust noted that she initially didn’t feel that way. But through writing the book, she gained historical perspective and came to understand brain research as part of the typical scientific process.</p>



<p>She likened current work to the quest to measure temperature in the 17th century, a period of iteration when tools and questions improved through trial and error.</p>



<p>“I started this book project as kind of a personal journey,” Rust said. “I started pessimistic as a brain researcher, because I could not see the through line between what we were doing and what society needs from us. And I ended up optimistic. … I understand why treating some brain and mental conditions is so incredibly formidable. I believe that for the first time in history, we’re ready to face those challenges head-on.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>In December 1967, as Americans grappled with social unrest over the Vietnam War and growing protests to end racial inequality, Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://www.crmvet.org/docs/6712_mlk_ppc-anc.pdf">said</a> the U.S. was “at a crossroads of history.”</p>



<p>Nearly 60 years later, the nation faces a similar moment amid political polarization and rising inequality, Darren Walker, the 2025 honoree of the <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/mlk-lecture/">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Lecture</a> at Harvard, told an audience gathered Monday in Memorial Church.</p>



<p>“Today, I believe, America once again is at ‘a crossroads of history,’” Walker said. “America, once again, must ‘choose a new path and move upon it with resolution and courage.’ America, once again, must ‘work creatively against despair … and against indifference.’”</p>

<p>Democracy faces existential peril in the U.S. due to growing inequality, said Walker. According to a 2024 <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60807">report</a> from the Congressional Budget Office, in 2022 families in the top 10 percent of the distribution held 60 percent of all wealth in the country.</p>



<p>“We got here because of the inequality about which Dr. King cautioned all those years ago,” said Walker. “The fact is, through the decades, America’s mobility escalator has slowed and halted for many. As a result, a pernicious form of distrust and hopelessness has entrenched itself among people of all communities — among people of all races and regions, in red states and blue ones. This is the crisis of our time — the crisis long simmering beneath the surface.”</p>



<p>Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, spoke at the fourth MLK Lecture commemorating the 1962 speech King gave at Harvard on the future of integration. Organized by <a href="https://ccl.harvard.edu/">Community and Campus Life</a>, the annual event recognizes individuals for their contributions to advancing justice and equality. Past honorees are Freeman A. Hrabowski III, president emeritus of The University of Maryland, Baltimore County; former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch; and civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel emeritus of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</p>



<p>“Tonight, we gather in this sanctuary to honor another leader who has worked tirelessly at the intersection of justice, service, and hope,” Harvard President Alan Garber said, describing Walker as “a steadfast advocate for equality and opportunity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div></div></div></section>



<p>Before becoming the president of the Ford Foundation, a $16 billion international social justice philanthropy, Walker was vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation. He co-founded both the U.S. Impact Investing Alliance and the Presidents’ Council on Disability Inclusion in Philanthropy. In 2024, then-President Joe Biden awarded Walker the National Humanities Medal.</p>



<p>Walker lamented today’s deep divide in American society, the normalization of contempt and hatred, and the epidemic of indifference to injustices of all kinds. He urged the audience to choose “resolution and courage over despair,” and “active, engaged citizenship” over indifference, and to recommit to “the idea of America,” where “radical ideas and noble aspirations” were brought to life by “the righteous actions” of people such as King and others who had the “courage to make wrong into right.”</p>



<p>During a conversation with Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, following his address, Walker reminisced about his improbable rise from his birth in a Louisiana charity hospital and his childhood in Ames, Texas, to the helm of one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations. When he was appointed president in 2013, Walker became the second Black American to lead the Ford Foundation.</p>



<p>“I was born in an America where poor little Black boys and girls who lived in shotgun shacks and dirt roads in rural Texas could dream,” said Walker, a member of the first Head Start class in 1965 and the recipient of B.A., B.S., and J.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin. “This is what I worry about today. Do those little Black and white and brown boys and girls living in places like Ames, Texas, feel as I felt that America is cheering them on, that their country wants them to succeed?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)"><blockquote><p>“America’s mobility escalator has slowed and halted for many. As a result, a pernicious form of distrust and hopelessness has entrenched itself among people of all communities.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Walker, who wrote the book “The Idea of America: Reflections on Inequality, Democracy, and the Values We Share,” released last month, asked the audience to work together to realize the promise of American democracy.</p>



<p>“America has only fully functioned as a democracy for one lifetime — for my lifetime,” said Walker. “When I was a child, the adults in my life could not vote in our Louisiana and Texas towns. I was 6 years old when the Voting Rights Act was passed. And even these protections are hollowed out by the day — as are so many of our fundamental rights. For my part, though, I believe that our American compass is still true.”</p>



<p>In closing, Walker asked his listeners to pursue optimism instead of despondency and fight against inequality to save democracy. “Hope is the oxygen of democracy, while inequality suffocates democracy,” he said.</p>



<p>“Like the poet says, America has never been America to me,” said Walker quoting Langston Hughes’ <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/147907/let-america-be-america-again">poem</a> “Let America Be America Again.”</p>



<p>“But it can be — and it will be — if we work against ‘despair and indifference.’ It can be — and will be — when, as Dr. King said at Harvard in 1962: ‘We emerge from the bleak and desolate midnight of man’s inhumanity — and into the bright and glittering daybreak of freedom and justice.’”</p>

<p>As senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, Penny Pritzker ’81 has been deeply engaged in supporting and advising President Alan Garber during a tumultuous period for the University. The adversity Harvard has faced in recent years is “unprecedented,” she said, and has tested the University to “stand by the guiding principles of our community.”</p>



<p>In this edited interview, Pritzker, a private sector leader and public servant, reflects on events of recent months, the progress Harvard is making, the University’s financial position, the work of the Corporation, and the experience of becoming a Harvard student once again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-narrow-single-line"/>



<p><strong>This has clearly been a difficult year for the University. I guess the obvious starting point is what’s on your mind as you think about Harvard at this moment?</strong></p>



<p>Look, I am a realist and we can’t sugarcoat what has been a period of severe challenge for Harvard and for higher education. Our approach to the situation under President Garber’s leadership and as a Corporation has been to ground ourselves in Harvard’s values. That has led us to do three things simultaneously, and they aren’t mutually exclusive.</p>



<p>First, we’ve articulated and regrounded ourselves in our core research and teaching mission. From new research on AI and quantum science to potentially life-saving advances in the study of Alzheimer’s, cancer, and gene editing, the research mission continues to demonstrate the power of universities to contribute to the national interest and to making countless lives better. And, of course, we remain focused on helping students grow into citizen-leaders who will make a positive impact in the world.</p>



<p>Second, we are working hard and with a lot of humility to address the legitimate challenges on our campus. We’ve taken important steps to tackle discrimination and bias, building on the exceptional work of the task forces on <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/task-force-on-antisemitism/">antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias</a> and on <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/task-force-on-anti-muslim-and-anti-arab-bias/">anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian&nbsp;bias</a>. As an institution we’ve made good progress on the implementation of the recommendations of those task forces, and that work must continue.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-ea4987e3-6e36-43b4-9672-ecd94cede177">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“This has been the touchstone in every single conversation among the Corporation about the crisis: How do we advance the mission and stand by the guiding principles of our community?”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p>We have introduced Harvard’s <a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/institutional_voice_principles_FAQs">institutional voice policy</a>, and we are making real progress on reaffirming a culture of constructive dialogue and open inquiry. We are all aware of the problem — reports of students and faculty feeling unable to speak out in class, to express what they may feel is a minority view. The work led by Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Eric Beerbohm, and the <a href="https://provost.harvard.edu/report-open-inquiry-and-constructive-dialogue">Open Inquiry Working Group</a> is helping us craft real solutions to a problem that is not unique to Harvard, but is shared across higher education. In every School at Harvard there are meaningful efforts to address these issues, working to build skills that will ensure graduates can be open to changing their minds and can hear their assumptions challenged.</p>



<p>Finally, we are seeking to address a wide range of unprecedented threats to our core principles, loss of research funding, challenges for international students, and the dozens of investigations and inquiries into various aspects of our work.</p>



<p>In every instance, my number one focus and that of the Corporation is to provide advice and make decisions that support Harvard’s fundamental mission of excellence in teaching, learning, and research. This has been the touchstone in every single conversation among the Corporation about the crisis: How do we advance the mission and stand by the guiding principles of our community? We have tried to ask hard questions and act with humility and curiosity in answering them.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned constructive dialogue as a key area of focus. You took the course that first-years take on this issue. Tell us about that.</strong></p>



<p>I did! I took the same online module that all first-year students take when they get to Harvard. This was a custom module developed for the College by the Constructive Dialogue Institute. The module is a powerful tool that has already had an impact on our incoming students. It challenges us to approach dialogue with empathy and understanding, to ask ourselves, “What are the values underlying this view that I disagree with?” “How can I approach disagreements with curiosity rather than defensiveness?” — to let go of winning and to find what is shared. I loved the program and have shared it with a lot of people beyond Harvard. These are skills not just lacking at universities; they are being lost across our society.</p>



<p>On the broader issue of dialogue and speech, the feedback we’re receiving from students and faculty is anecdotal but already very positive.</p>



<p><strong>Another area of concern has been the financial headwinds facing the University. Harvard’s </strong><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/10/harvard-reports-operating-deficit-amid-federal-funding-cuts/"><strong>financial report</strong></a><strong> came out earlier this month. How do you think about our financial standing?</strong></p>



<p>There is good news and bad news. Our supporters leaned in and made this a strong year for fundraising and our endowment performed well, but cuts to federal research funding and our efforts to fill that gap led to a deficit. Before we talk further about our finances, I want to say thank you to those who have and are supporting the University. It is important that folks know how deeply grateful we are for their trust and their generosity.</p>



<p>As for our finances, it is sobering and more important than ever to bring a multiyear perspective to the situation. We have to assume the model for federal-university partnership will not return to where it has been. There are measures in the administration’s budget and policies that would drastically shrink federal support for scientific research and would seek to direct funds away from institutions like Harvard. In addition, Congress passed a significant increase in the endowment tax that targets Harvard and a handful of other similar institutions. Plus, of course, there continues to be legal uncertainty — investigations and appeals that could directly target our funding.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this has meant painful decisions like layoffs and a hiring freeze. People have lost their jobs, and that weighs heavily on me and on all of us. We are making these decisions always in service to our core mission of teaching, learning, and research. Through all of this, I have been profoundly grateful for everything our community is doing to rally around the University and keep it moving forward.</p>



<p><strong>The Corporation itself has seen important changes over the past year. Can you talk about some of those?</strong></p>



<p>I should start by noting that the idea of reflection and renewal are constants among the Corporation. We always ask ourselves some key questions: How can we best serve the institution not just for the present but also for the long term? Do we have the right blend of experience and expertise? Where can we best engage with the wider community? I would point to a few changes in that context.</p>



<p>First, we have some new members of the Corporation — Joe Bae, Ken Frazier, Rick Lifton, Kannon Shanmugam — all of whom make unique and vital contributions to our deliberations, in part through embracing how the Corporation works: as a collegial, apolitical, consensus-focused group that brings disparate points of view and is not reluctant to express them. They also love Harvard deeply. As a group we are focused on discharging our duties as fiduciaries, but also as individuals, and as a body, we are deeply devoted to the purpose and progress of Harvard.</p>



<p>Second, we have undertaken a serious review of how we approach the presidential search process. Led by a small committee that includes members of the Corporation as well as alumni with deep commitment to the University, we are looking at how we can ensure the most thoughtful, thorough, and effective search at the appropriate time. This is a core role for the Fellows and one we are committed to getting right.</p>



<p>The third area I want to highlight is one that the Corporation takes very seriously: We have recommitted to being more intentionally engaged with members of the Harvard community. For example, we meet regularly with the deans of the Schools, participate in faculty town halls and meetings with faculty groups on a range of issues, engage with students to better understand their experience, and also meet with alumni and supporters of the University to hear their ideas and concerns. We’ve really sought to increase the volume and depth of engagement over the last couple of years. I know that it enhances our deliberations as a Corporation, and we will continue that work.</p>



<div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-1e3fa56d-043e-415c-a826-4ad56a41e575">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“People in our community and frankly others with no direct relationship to the University are dedicated to the ideal of what Harvard and higher education can do for our country and the world. That gives me hope.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<p><strong>As you pursue this engagement strategy, what are some of the key things you are hearing?</strong></p>



<p>We’re hearing a lot of support for President Garber and how he has led the University during an extraordinarily challenging time. He’s been very clear and proactive in conveying the principles that we stand for and in foregrounding the vital importance and work of research universities. He’s a person of deep integrity and impact — introducing much-needed reforms to strengthen our community, tackling bias in all its forms, and creating a culture of constructive dialogue. So there’s a great deal of appreciation for his purpose-driven leadership. Not everyone agrees with every step we are taking as a university, but there’s a widespread belief, I think, that Alan and the entire leadership team have the best interests of Harvard in mind as they make decisions.</p>



<p>Also, we hear a wide range of perspectives on the challenges the University is facing and the course we should be pursuing on behalf of Harvard and higher education. We welcome those perspectives. Whether those concerns are about our finances or research funding or outstanding legal matters, the input always comes from a place of goodwill for Harvard. People in our community and frankly others with no direct relationship to the University are dedicated to the ideal of what Harvard and higher education can do for our country and the world. That gives me hope.</p>



<p><strong>It might be natural, at a moment like this, to focus just on the challenges, but positive things have been happening on campus. What’s been most exciting to you and the Corporation?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are so many great things happening at Harvard. Our researchers making groundbreaking progress in diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases are an inspiration, especially at a moment when scientific research is under duress.</p>



<p>Across the University there is exciting, innovative work underway. The new <a href="https://artsandhumanities.fas.harvard.edu/public-culture-project">Public Culture Project</a> at the FAS will bring the critical thinking of the humanities to some of the biggest questions of our time, such as the evolution of AI and the moral principles underpinning economic life. At the Graduate School of Education, a team of researchers is <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/10/as-states-take-lead-in-fixing-u-s-schools-harvard-will-serve-as-a-hub/">undertaking a nine-state effort</a> to assess, measure, and share what actually drives student outcomes. And the <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/american-service-fellowship">American Service Fellowship</a> at the Kennedy School will provide full scholarships for public servants and military veterans to enroll for a fully funded master’s degree. These are just a few examples and there are many more across all of our Schools.</p>



<p>I also recently toured Allston, where I saw the <a href="https://americanrepertorytheater.org/a-new-home-in-allston/">new A.R.T</a>., the new <a href="https://rubensteintreehouse.harvard.edu/">Rubenstein Treehouse</a>, and the emerging <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/about-us/visit-us/allston/enterprise-research-campus">Enterprise Research Campus</a>. What’s happening across that growing section of campus is game-changing for the University and the Greater Boston region. The bottom line is that there are many significant and impactful things happening at Harvard, and we should not lose sight of that fact.</p>



<p><strong>We’re in the mid-semester period. What is your message to the community?</strong></p>



<p>I know that there is a lot of swirl and noise around Harvard and higher education. We have taken seriously the criticisms we’re hearing while defending the principles that underpin this great institution. I certainly don’t minimize the challenges we face.</p>



<p>But I want to shine a light on the powerful things happening on campus and the people making them happen: our students, who are an inspiration to me and all of us on the Corporation; the faculty and researchers who are advancing knowledge and making a difference in people’s lives; and the staff who come to work every day to enable our mission.</p>



<p>Harvard is not perfect, nor do we ever claim to be. This community gives so much to so many, including me. I came here at 18 at a very difficult time in my life and when I needed that support and love the most. Harvard changed my life and it does that for so many people. Our strength is in how we evolve to push new frontiers and to meet the moment we find ourselves in. I’m confident that this institution and its people will rise to the occasion together.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>You might call it the case of the missing carbon.</p>



<p>It was the 1980s. Scientists knew roughly how much carbon dioxide (CO₂) was being emitted globally by humans burning fossil fuels and by natural processes such as volcanos. They also knew how much CO₂ was in the atmosphere. These data showed that about half of the fossil fuel CO₂ was disappearing each year. But where was it going?</p>



<p>It was clear that forests absorb a lot: Plants fix carbon, through photosynthesis, into wood and other vegetation. But forests also emit. Microbes in the soil digest rotting leaves and dead wood, respiring carbon back into the sky.</p>



<p>Understanding which of those two processes dominates — forests’ absorption of carbon or their emission of it — is essential to predict the future of the carbon budget and climate change.</p>



<p>Atmospheric chemist <a href="https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/people/steven-c-wofsy/">Steven Wofsy</a> saw in this question an engineering challenge. By measuring CO₂ in the updrafts and downdrafts swirling around the forest canopy, over years, he realized he could account for the role of forests in the carbon cycle.</p>



<p>He’s been measuring ever since.</p>



<p>Eight times a second, every minute, every day since October 1989, a 100-foot lattice tower poking above the canopy at Harvard Forest has been analyzing the carbon exchange. As tiny eddies of air shuttle gases up and down, an infrared spectrometer measures concentrations of CO₂ and water vapor, while a 3D sonic anemometer logs vertical and horizontal wind speed. Over time, the covariance shows how much carbon the forest absorbed or released — the net exchange with the atmosphere, also known as the eddy flux.</p>

<p>The early data shocked Wofsy and his team: The oaks and maples and scattered conifers around the tower were absorbing roughly 2 tons of carbon per hectare per year. The data proved that Harvard Forest — 16 square kilometers in central Massachusetts where farms and pastures had been abandoned in the 19th century — was not yet at steady state; it was still a net carbon sink. They had found the missing carbon — and, more important, the way to measure it.</p>



<p>“Most people thought these forests had fully regenerated after being farmland and were already full of carbon,” said Wofsy, the Abbott Lawrence Rotch Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Science.</p>



<p>The findings inspired a network of towers, now hundreds strong, around the world, from Korea to Congo. These inform policy and land-use decisions. Progress on climate change requires hard choices — keep a forest standing or clear it for a solar farm — and the flux towers underwrite the rigorous carbon accounting that confirms which options truly reduce atmospheric CO₂.</p>



<p>Now in its fourth decade, and source of the world’s longest-running flux data set, the Environmental Measurement Station (EMS) tower at Harvard Forest is reaching the end of its lifespan. With support from the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, EMS 2.0 was installed this summer. It will carry on collecting data as the changing climate becomes harder to ignore.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-neue-haas-grotesk-text-font-family" id="h-deposits-and-withdrawals"><strong>Deposits and withdrawals</strong></h5>



<p>To understand carbon flux, picture a simple accounting ledger, explains <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/bill-munger">William Munger</a>, senior research fellow in atmospheric chemistry at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who has worked on the EMS project from the start.</p>



<p>Deposits are photosynthesis; that’s carbon uptake, or fixed carbon. Withdrawals are respiration, when decomposing plants release CO₂. In this metaphor, the temperate forests in Massachusetts are posting steady deposits into the “carbon bank” — for now.</p>



<p>“The EMS data show very clearly that winters are not what they used to be,” said Munger. “Annual variability jumped in the 2000s.” Like the rest of southern New England, Harvard Forest now gets less snow — meaning less spring meltwater to encourage growth. Snowpack once insulated roots; without it, more trees die during a deep freeze. Less water and more dead trees both cut the forest’s carbon uptake.</p>



<p>“A few years after a dry year, you see a dip in carbon respiration — when you’d expect those leaves to be decomposing.”</p>



<p>After monitoring a decade of steady deposits, the EMS tower saw carbon uptake double for a few years before falling, for one year, to zero. These oscillations show a system highly responsive to disturbance and climate variability.</p>



<p>“The tower lets us observe the way the forest responds to major seasonal and annual weather fluctuations, and to track the carbon cycle,” said Wofsy. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)"><blockquote><p>“Plants, animals, and soil microbes take in 25 to 30 percent of our emitted carbon dioxide. Should it stop, we’re in trouble.”</p><cite>Michele Holbrook</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Flux towers are also keeping an eye on some of the world’s largest carbon deposits.</p>



<p>In the Amazon, rapid photosynthesis by mammoth trees is offset by equally intense respiration from warm, wet soil and tireless decomposers, yielding near-zero net annual change. In the boreal forests of the north, the soil contains millennia of peat and cold-stabilized organic matter — vast carbon stores accumulated since the ice retreated. Disturbances such as fire, drought, or thaw trigger fast, <a href="https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/canada-used-to-send-clean-cool-air-harvard-scientist-explains-the-new-reality-of-wildfire-season/">whopping withdrawals</a> that may be pushing them toward tipping points.</p>



<p>“We need to know what these forests are doing, and long-term research is the only way,” said <a href="https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/people/n-michele-holbrook/">Michele Holbrook</a>, the Charles Bullard Professor of Forestry. “It’s hard to detect change when there’s so much year-to-year variation. You need decadal records. That’s what makes the tower, and the data it has collected, so important. In the global carbon cycle, the terrestrial biosphere — plants, animals, and soil microbes — takes in 25 to 30 percent of our emitted CO₂. Should it stop, we’re in trouble.”</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-neue-haas-grotesk-text-font-family" id="h-biodiversity-in-flux"><strong>Biodiversity in flux</strong></h5>



<p>To a casual observer, Harvard Forest looks to be thriving. In the fall, the brush is so thick it can be hard to see the new tower from 50 feet away — perfect cover for cedar waxwings, great horned owls, and the occasional bobcat. A new shed houses the recording instruments and computers. Porcupines had gnawed into the old wooden building.</p>



<p>But the forest is changing. The native hemlock, ash, and beech are fading under blights spread by human movement and trade.</p>



<p>EMS 2.0 will measure the forest’s breathing well into the future, offering insights as the planet warms and the global community struggles to mitigate carbon emissions. It cannot see the slow turnover of species that will shape those numbers, but the tower will show how the system’s carbon balance shifts as the climate warms and invasive pests restructure the canopy.</p>



<p>“There aren’t that many species in this forest,” said Wofsy. “You’re really watching the forest be transformed by climate change and exotic species. That’s what lies ahead.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Catherine Dulac, Noah Feldman, Claudia Goldin, and Cumrun Vafa were recognized with appointments as University Professors, the highest distinction a faculty member can receive at the University. The <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/about/university-professorships/">title</a> was created in 1935 to honor individuals whose groundbreaking work crosses the boundaries of multiple disciplines, allowing them to pursue research at any of Harvard’s Schools.</p>



<p>“University Professors embody the academic excellence that Harvard seeks to nurture in every generation,” said President Alan M. Garber. “Catherine, Claudia, Noah, and Cumrun are outstanding colleagues and superb University citizens. They represent not only the potential of individual scholars but also the timelessness of our mission to expand the frontiers of knowledge for the benefit of humanity. It is an honor to acknowledge their achievements and to celebrate their contributions to academia and to our community.”</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/directory/catherine-dulac/">Dulac</a>, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who was most recently the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/11/harvard-names-three-new-university-professors/">Samuel W. Morris University Professor</a>, will now be the Xander University Professor. The professorship was created for “an eminent scholar whose work focuses on new or emerging areas of scientific inquiry, especially areas at the intersection or interstices of existing scientific disciplines and fields.” Dulac succeeds <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/06/sons-diabetes-diagnosis-sent-scientist-on-quest-for-cure/">Douglas Melton</a>, who remains at Harvard as Catalyst Professor.</li>



<li><a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/noah-r-feldman/">Feldman</a>, the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, chair of the Society of Fellows, and founding director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Program on Jewish and Israeli Law, has been named the Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor. The appointment honors a scholar in the humanities.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.economics.harvard.edu/people/claudia-goldin">Goldin</a>, the Henry Lee Professor of Economics and the Lee and Ezpeleta Professor of Arts and Sciences, has been appointed the Samuel W. Morris University Professor. The professorship was established to support a faculty member in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vafa">Vafa</a>, the Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy and chair of the Department of Physics, has been appointed the Timken University Professor. The appointment was established to honor a distinguished scholar in any field of science.</li>
</ul>



<p>“These four appointments represent the extraordinary breadth of excellence across our University,” said Harvard University Provost John F. Manning. “Not only are they great scholars and teachers, they are also extraordinary institutional contributors.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="h-catherine-dulac">Catherine Dulac</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-h-5-title-font-size" id="h-xander-university-professor" style="margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0">Xander University Professor</h2>
</div>



<p>“It is a great honor to be named the Xander University Professor, and I wish to express my deep gratitude for this distinction and for the recognition of the research in my group,” Dulac said. “I feel extremely fortunate to be a faculty at Harvard and have the chance to interact daily with so many highly talented students, amazing lab members, and inspiring staff and colleagues, while fulfilling our scientific and teaching mission.”</p>



<p>Dulac has spent nearly two decades at Harvard working to expand the understanding of the neural processes underlying instinctive social behaviors, a set of brain functions that are typically impaired in mental illness. These functions include parental care and the brain’s responses to sickness and social isolation.</p>



<p>She has long been driven by a deep fascination with the interplay between social interactions and the human brain. In 2021, Dulac was awarded the prestigious <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/catherine-dulac-rewarded-for-study-of-parenting-behavior/">Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences</a> for her research, which identified the neuronal circuits that control these behaviors and questioned the long-held belief that different circuits develop in male and female brains.</p>



<p>Dulac also started investigating social isolation and its effects on the brain in a new project that became particularly relevant during the pandemic. Her research indicates that the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/02/is-social-connection-a-basic-need-like-food-water/">need for social connection</a> has similar neural circuitry as physiological needs, such as those for food, water, and sleep.</p>



<p>In addition to the Breakthrough Prize, Dulac has received the 2006 Richard Lounsbery Award and the 2015 National Academy of Sciences’ <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/04/three-faculty-members-receive-nas-awards/">Pradel Research Award</a>.</p>



<p>She is an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the French Academie des Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In addition, she is an officer of the French Legion d’Honneur.</p>



<p>Dulac graduated from École Normale Supérieure in Paris and received her Ph.D. from the University of Paris VI at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Embryology of the College de France.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="h-noah-feldman">Noah Feldman</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-h-5-title-font-size" id="h-arthur-kingsley-porter-university-professor" style="margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0">Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor</h2>
</div>



<p>Feldman is a constitutional scholar whose work uses history, philosophy, literature, and religious studies to shed light on how we form and sustain communities in keeping with our values.</p>



<p>A prolific author, Feldman has written 10 books, including an ongoing series that traces the history of American constitutional ideas through the major figures who shaped them and another sequence on the trajectory of contemporary Islamic political thought.</p>



<p>“I’m deeply moved by this honor,” Feldman said. “I’m working on a book about the importance of being human in an age of artificial intelligence, so it is especially meaningful to hold a chair associated with humanistic study.”</p>



<p>Since 2020, Feldman has chaired Harvard’s Society of Fellows, the oldest and most eminent postdoctoral program in the U.S., which draws scholars from all disciplines. He was a junior fellow of the Society from 1998 to 2001 and became a senior fellow in 2010.</p>



<p>At Harvard Law School, Feldman is founding director of the <a href="https://pjil.law.harvard.edu/">Julis-Rabinowitz Program</a>, which strives “to present the full range of opinion and critique, internal and external, consistent always with the academic values of civility, openness, and mutual respect.”</p>



<p>In 2024, Feldman co-chaired the University’s Institutional Voice Working Group, which issued a report on official University statements about social and political matters.</p>



<p>“The main point of the report is that the University’s leadership can and should speak out on anything relevant to the core function of the University, which is creating an environment suitable for free, open inquiry, teaching, and research,” Feldman said at the time of the report’s release. “At the same time, the University as an institution should not make official statements on issues outside its core function.”</p>



<p>Feldman received his A.B. from Harvard summa cum laude, finishing first in his class. He earned his D.Phil. from Oxford University, where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar, and J.D. from Yale Law School, after which he clerked for Justice David H. Souter of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>



<p>He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center" id="h-claudia-goldin">Claudia Goldin</h3>

</div>



<p>A pioneer in the field of economic history, Goldin has explored women’s job market outcomes, their experiences balancing career and family, educational change, and the gender earnings gap across U.S. history.</p>



<p>In 2023, Goldin was <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/10/harvard-claudia-goldin-recognized-with-nobel-in-economic-sciences/">awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</a> “for having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes.”</p>



<p>After winning the prize, Goldin explained why she chose her area of study.</p>



<p>“When I first started working on this subject, I realized that most economic historians were studying child labor, or they were studying the labor of men,” she said. “But they didn’t really know what women were doing. And so that’s what I worked on.”</p>



<p>Goldin is known for her dedication to her students. The day after her Nobel win, she kept previously scheduled meetings, staying late at the office in Littauer Center with her “muses.”</p>



<p>Goldin is currently co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Gender in the Economy group and is a member of various academies and societies, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Society of Labor Economists.</p>



<p>She received the 2019 BBVA Frontiers in Knowledge Award, the IZA Prize in Labor Economics in 2016, and the Mincer Prize in Labor Economics in 2009.</p>



<p>“The Race between Education and Technology,” a book by Goldin and Lawrence Katz, the Elisabeth Allison Professor of Economics, was awarded the 2008 R.R. Hawkins Award. Goldin’s most recent book, “Career and Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity,” has been translated into more than a dozen languages.</p>



<p>Goldin received her B.A. from Cornell University and her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.</p>



<p>As a University Professor, Goldin will explore the expansion of women’s rights, the tensions between traditionalists and feminists, and why rights in the U.S. have increased but caregiving benefits have not kept up.</p>



<p>“I am deeply honored and thank President Garber for this unique opportunity,” Goldin said. “I look forward to creating a course to introduce our undergraduates to the cross-disciplinary insights of economic history that will reflect the true meaning of being a University Professor.”</p>

</div>



<p>A prominent theoretical physicist, Vafa’s mathematical creativity has redefined modern theoretical physics and deeply influenced the fields of string theory, quantum gravity, and mathematical physics. His extensive achievements include developing topological string theory, uncovering holographic aspects of black holes, and formulating observable implications of string theory in cosmology and particle physics.</p>



<p>Vafa has also deepened the understanding of duality — showing how distinct theories can describe the same phenomena — through seminal work that yielded the Strominger-Vafa explanation of black hole entropy and the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants linking physics and enumerative geometry.</p>



<p>More recently, his leadership in the <a href="https://swampland-initiative.physics.harvard.edu/">Swampland Initiative</a> yielded predictive models for dark energy and dark matter, offering one of the most coherent theoretical frameworks consistent with the latest cosmological observations.</p>



<p>“It is truly humbling to receive this news,” said Vafa. “Every day at Harvard, I’m reminded that I am simply one faculty member among so many extraordinary colleagues, remarkable students, and dedicated staff.”</p>



<p>Vafa earned his B.S. in math and physics at MIT and his Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Princeton. He joined Harvard as a junior fellow in the Society of Fellows and became a faculty member in 1988. Vafa has been honored with the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/12/recognition-for-discoveries/">2017 Breakthrough Prize</a> in Fundamental Physics and the 2013 <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/two-recognized-for-physics-research/">Physics Frontiers Prize.</a></p>



<p>“I was born in Iran, the home of many eminent scientists and mathematicians. In my pursuit of science, I was inspired by their legacy,” Vafa said when accepting the Frontiers Prize. “I view science as a timeless, borderless adventure where everyone can participate, and it can bring out the best in humanity.”</p>



<p>Vafa also received the Dirac Medal of International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 2008, the 2016 Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, and an <a href="https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu/news/professor-cumrun-vafa-awarded-honorary-doctors-appointment-uppsala-university">Honorary Doctors Appointment at Uppsala University in 2019</a>. In addition, he was honored with the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/vafa-receives-ellis-island-medal-of-honor/">2017 Ellis Island Medal of Honor</a>, which “celebrates inspiring Americans who are selflessly working for the betterment of our country and its citizens.”</p>



<p>Vafa is an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

			Are outdated teaching methods to blame for declining U.S. reading scores?		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Average reading scores for fourth-grade students in 2024 dropped two points since 2022 and five points since 2019, as measured by the so-called <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/">nation’s report card</a>. But according to a recent talk at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, the trend of American children reading below their grade levels stretches back decades before the pandemic — and teaching methods that fail to adequately challenge students, counterintuitive as it may seem, could be the culprit.</p>



<p>“Look at data all the way back, starting in 1969. We’ve never improved,” said educator <a href="https://www.shanahanonliteracy.com/">Timothy Shanahan</a>, author of “<a href="https://hep.gse.harvard.edu/9798895570036/leveled-reading-leveled-lives/">Leveled Reading, Leveled Lives: How Students’ Reading Achievement Has Been Held Back and What We Can Do About It</a>.” “While the need for literacy has been increasing over the last five decades, kids’ literacy has not improved in the United States.”</p>



<p>The problem, said Shanahan, who joined Ed School Dean <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/nonie-lesaux">Nonie K. Lesaux</a> for the <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/community/library/book-talks">Gutman Library Virtual Book Talk</a>, is rooted in an outdated premise. “There’s been a theory in reading education for about 100 years that if we’re going to be successful, we have to teach students at their level.” After years of testing ideas about “what ‘their level’ meant,” he said, educators arrived at a kind of consensus: Students are asked to read supposed grade-level passages and are then tested on their comprehension of them.</p>



<p>The problem with that approach is that it lacks challenge. “There’s nothing for the kids to learn,” said Shanahan, distinguished professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chi­cago, where he is founding di­rector of the UIC Center for Literacy.</p>



<p>The solution Shanahan outlined is to challenge students — but give them the right tools and support. For example, he proposed stopping the common practice of “pre-teaching” the vocabulary of a text before students try to read it. “We’re teaching words that are defined in the text. We’re teaching words you could figure out in context.” The result is that “kids are not seeing the text as something to be solved.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think kids enjoy it very much, and they’re not learning reading,” said Shanahan. “They’re just accumulating words.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)"><blockquote><p>“We assume they’re de-motivated by difficulty. But research shows they’re de-motivated by the reading instruction.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Questioning past assumptions is key. “We assume they’re de-motivated by difficulty,” he said. “But research shows they’re de-motivated by the reading instruction,” which, he stressed, can come across as “pretty babyish.”</p>



<p>Shanahan identified four basic concepts students learn in order to read: words and parts of words (morphology); fluency, which he defined as “where to pause and where to put emphasis” while reading; comprehension, or a grasp of an entire text; and writing, the ability to create texts on their own.</p>



<p>To master these, students must tackle texts that “pose linguistic or cognitive challenges,” he said.</p>



<p>“That might mean figuring out unknown words or figuring out sentences of complexity. What do you do with pronouns? What if there are too many pronouns? You want texts that are going to pose problems for kids.”</p>



<p>Instead of simply focusing on reading ability when choosing texts, teachers must look for content that will be interesting or engaging, or that has some social connection.</p>



<p>“Kids want to read harder stuff,” Shanahan said. Looking back on his beginners, he noted, “Even the lowest readers took on ‘Harry Potter,’” which mattered to their peer group. “Everybody wanted to be part of it.”</p>



<p>“We shouldn’t be trying to limit what kids take on,” he said. Instead, teachers and librarians should encourage readers to try new books, and offer them alternatives if what they first attempted proves too hard. “There’s nothing shameful in that,” he said. “We don’t want them afraid.”</p>



<p>Throughout the talk, Shanahan referred to the theories of Soviet Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, which emphasize learning through social interaction and making connections between prior knowledge and new information. Vygotsky, who studied children’s educational development, championed the idea of “scaffolding,” basically supporting learners so they can reach for a higher level on their own. The theory works for adults too, Shanahan said, as he discovered when he joined a group to read James Joyce’s “Ulysses.”</p>



<p>“I’d read it twice on my own. The first time I got nothing. The second time I felt I got a theme — one important but tiny theme in the book,” said Shanahan. With the group, he got much more out of this difficult text. “I needed a lot of support to read that book. It was a problem to be solved.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Anti-Zionism doesn’t top Michelle Goldberg’s list of fears.</p>



<p>“When I think about my future in the country, my family’s future in this country, I am so much more threatened by people who are opposed to pluralism,” said The New York Times columnist who describes herself as a secular Jew. “Our traditions of liberal pluralism are why Jews have thrived in the United States.”</p>



<p>Goldberg was on campus earlier this month for the 2025 Doft Lecture, hosted annually by the <a href="https://cjs.fas.harvard.edu/">Center for Jewish Studies.</a> Her wide-ranging conversation with center Director <a href="https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/derek-penslar">Derek J. Penslar</a>, William Lee Frost Professor of Jewish History, covered everything from free speech to hate speech at an event titled “Authoritarianism, Antisemitism &amp; the Future of America.”</p>



<p>Goldberg explained that she doesn’t necessarily equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism.</p>



<p>As she has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/opinion/antisemitism-vs-anti-zionism.html">noted in her work,</a> trying to force Jewish Americans, with their deep cultural and religious attachments to Israel, to disavow the movement for a Jewish nation is unquestionably antisemitic. But some Israel critics like New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani have been unfairly tarred as antisemites, she said.</p>



<p>They can’t reconcile the Jewish state with their commitments to pluralism, Goldberg said. “They basically say every state should be a state for all of its citizens. You can argue with that. You can say it’s naïve. But I fundamentally do not find it threatening.”</p>



<p>Penslar observed how adept partisans are at identifying antisemitism in their political opponents. “Do you honestly believe that antisemitism is primarily on one side or the other?” he asked.</p>



<p>“I deeply, honestly believe it’s worse on the right,” Goldberg replied, citing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146">Politico’s recent report</a> on a leaked chat of Young Republicans leaders praising Hitler.</p>



<p>Goldberg later amended that. “I just think the antisemites on the left have dramatically less power,” she said.</p>



<p>Penslar asked where Goldberg draws the line between embracing viewpoint diversity and disavowing reprehensible ideas.</p>



<p>The Buffalo, N.Y., native whose political awakening came with pro-choice activism in the 1990s, spoke to the dangers of “artificially narrowing the boundaries of debate.” She cited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-coalition-supporters.html">her reporting</a> on how experts’ refusal to engage with concerns about COVID vaccines turned everyday skeptics into hard-line opponents.</p>



<p>At the other extreme, she sees the right embracing an ethos of “just asking questions” to jump the old guardrails on political speech and advance prejudice and untruths.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t know that anybody can say, ‘Here’s where the boundary should be,” she said.</p>



<p>Noting the rise of support among some Hispanic Americans for Donald Trump in 2024, Penslar wondered whether the values of pluralism mandate political consideration for the social conservatism of that segment of the voting bloc. Goldberg suggested that certain policy goals, such as banning same-sex marriage or outlawing abortion, may be incompatible with democracy.</p>



<p>The issue of immigration is next-level tricky. “I think most Democrats probably see America giving asylum to refugees as something sacred and fundamental,” she said.</p>



<p>Maintaining that access, while addressing some citizens’ concerns with immigration system abuses, would require increased infrastructure and investments.</p>



<p>“It’s much easier for Republicans, who don’t care about those values in the first place, to just say, ‘We’re just going to shut it down,’” Goldberg said.</p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A portion of the event, audience members and students solicited Goldberg’s thoughts on podcasting, polarized media, and where she sees distinctly American patterns in 21st-century attitudes toward Jewish populations.</p>



<p>“We are the country with the most Jews outside of Israel,” Goldberg said. There’s a “particular insult,” she continued, in attempts to dismantle institutions where Jewish Americans have historically thrived, like universities, “in the name of fighting antisemitism.”</p>



<p>Another audience member asked how much credit Trump deserves for brokering a ceasefire, however fragile, in Gaza, with the return of all living Israeli hostages. “A lot of credit,” she replied, but “not in the way certain people on the right are saying.”</p>



<p>This was essentially <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3yke64vp6o">“the same formula”</a> that was on the table in January, when President Joe Biden was still in office, she argued. Trump was able to land a deal by “force of personality, by not being bound to certain norms of American diplomacy.”</p>



<p>Today’s Republican Party also gives Trump enormous leeway to act as he pleases, Goldberg added. “I actually think if Biden had forced [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to accept the exact same deal, the Republicans would be saying he had sold out Israel.”</p>

<p>Higher education may be an important source of economic and social mobility, but it doesn’t do nearly enough to meaningfully reduce inequality in the U.S., according to political philosopher Michael Sandel.</p>



<p>And the prestige that elite schools enjoy reinforces privilege, and often leads graduates to see themselves as society’s rightful winners, he added. </p>



<p>“[That] leads to hubris among the winners, leads them to inhale too deeply of their own success, to forget the luck and good fortune that helped them on their way, to forget their indebtedness to those who made their achievements possible,” Sandel said during a lecture last Thursday at <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/">Harvard Radcliffe Institute</a>. “And it leads to humiliation to those left behind, those less fortunate than themselves.”</p>

<p>The lecture, titled “Does Meritocracy Undermine Democracy?” and moderated by Harvard Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin, was followed by a panel discussion with economist and Harvard College Dean <a href="https://www.daviddeming.com/">David Deming</a> and Harvard Law School Professor <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/randall-l-kennedy/">Randall Kennedy</a>. It was the first in a new series that’s part of a five-year <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/about-the-institute/our-work/academic-freedom">initiative</a> launched last fall at Radcliffe to promote civil discourse and academic freedom.</p>



<p>The current populist backlash against higher ed is driven in large part by a view among many working people “that credentialed elites look down on them,” said Sandel, the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government. It’s “a legitimate complaint” given that 62 percent of Americans don’t have a four-year college degree, and it deepens cultural divisions.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Top colleges and universities can begin to counteract that perception by using a lottery system to select from among the thousands of worthy and qualified students who apply each year.</p>



<p>A lottery would minimize the significant advantages wealthy applicants still retain in the “meritocratic tournament of college admissions” and relieve high school students of the relentless pressure to compete with each other, argued Sandel, who has written widely on the topics of justice and inequity, including 2020’s “The Tyranny of Merit.”</p>



<p>Deming, an economist who studies education, supports the lottery idea and the principle of greater transparency that’s behind it, but disagreed with Sandel that higher education is undermining democracy. The country should make greater investments in higher education so more people can attend and thrive, he said.</p>



<p>“We’ve gone from a world where probably only one in 10 or one in eight people need to go to college to a world where almost everyone does, and yet we don’t spend enough money as a society on providing the resources to make that possible,” said Deming.</p>

<p>“The fundamental source of inequality is that so many young people who have talent but are not ready to take full advantage of those talents are not able to achieve their potential because they do not have the resources devoted to them that a place like Harvard or other universities provide,” said Deming, who noted half of the Class of 2029 pays no tuition.</p>



<p>Kennedy said while he shared Sandel’s criticism of meritocratic hubris, eliminating all competition between students is not an effective solution to rising inequality.</p>



<p>One driver of populist complaints about higher education that gets overlooked is the “aggressive, anti-meritocratic envy and resentment” of those attacking Harvard and other colleges and universities, said Kennedy, a scholar of racial equality. There’s also been “a concerted campaign to vilify the universities and undercut the public’s trust” by political partisans in the media, he said. </p>



<p>“The subtext of some of your remarks was that we have brought it on ourselves and deserve to be brought low,” Kennedy said to Sandel. “I don’t think so. I think at this moment, we face the perennial adversaries of excellence, and we need to be willing to protect legitimate meritocracy.”</p>



<p>To win back and be worthy of public trust, higher education needs to “vindicate our public purpose,” said Sandel, who was <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/justice-professor-michael-sandel-wins-1m-philosophy-prize/">awarded</a> the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture earlier this month.</p>



<p>“We have to show that in addition to launching our students on successful careers, we are institutions who serve the public good, and I think we’ve strayed from that mission,” he said.</p>



<p>“I think we can and should do more to show that that our mission is not to promote private privilege, but to contribute to the public good.”</p>

			New research by Claudia Goldin extends her work on how, why cultural changes around gender are driving down fertility in U.S., elsewhere		</h2>
		
</header>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>Fertility rates began falling in most of the world starting in the last century. By the 1970s, the U.S. had dipped under the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, a trend that has continued on a declining slope.</p>



<p>In her new working paper, “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34268?utm_campaign=ntwh&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntwg5">The Downside of Fertility</a>,” Claudia Goldin, the Henry Lee Professor of Economics, takes a deeper dive into the cultural changes around gender that are driving down fertility rates.</p>



<p>The economic historian and <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/10/harvard-claudia-goldin-recognized-with-nobel-in-economic-sciences/">2023 Nobel laureate</a> introduced <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/01/need-to-boost-population-encourage-dads-to-step-up-at-home/">a model</a> in a previous publication that links low fertility rates to higher levels of friction between the sides around gender and generation. This paper, she said, tackles a seeming contradiction in the data.</p>



<p>Across the 18th and 19th centuries increases in the birth rate were seen during periods of prosperity or at the end of economic downturns, as evidenced by the post-World War II baby boom. However, since the later part of the 20th century, that link no longer holds true.</p>



<p>“One of the great demographic surprises” of this time, Goldin writes, “has been the negative relationship between per capita income levels and fertility.”</p>



<p>Although fertility rates fell earlier and faster in developed countries, defined by Goldin as members of the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en.html">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>, they have now gone down even in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-right:0;margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0"><blockquote><p>“When you look at what these birth rates were for just the previous generation, it’s astronomical change.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The fertility decline is just about everywhere,” said Goldin, who is also the Lee and Ezpeleta Professor of Arts and Sciences.</p>



<p>The wealthier Middle Eastern countries had birth rates around six or seven children per woman, but the United Arab Emirates “has a birth rate now that is lower or about the same as baby-scarce Japan,” dipping “to about 1.2,” Goldin said, while the birth rate in Saudi Arabia is 2.3.</p>



<p>“When you look at what these birth rates were for just the previous generation, it’s astronomical change,” she said.</p>



<p>The global shift, she continued, can be traced to one common cause: the increased agency of women, who during the last century became increasingly able to opt out of traditional family roles to pursue other options, such as education and careers.</p>



<p>“Wherever you get increased agency, you get reduction in the birth rate,” said Goldin. “The central cause arises when women have autonomy and have the ability to be educated, to have occupations and careers.”</p>



<p>This can lead to conflict with men, who are more comfortable with traditional roles. “Men don’t want to give up what they had in the past,” Goldin said.</p>



<p>Goldin’s close read on the historical patterns revealed fascinating subtleties.</p>



<p>Fertility rates were declining at a slower pace in the U.S. until the onset of the “Great Recession” in 2007. In Northern Europe, rates started declining faster in 2010.</p>



<p>However, the decreases were “substantial” among college graduates, who delayed or avoided having children despite, on average, enjoying higher earnings. This avoidance is “testament to the mismatch factors” that Goldin has brought to light in <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/10/excerpt-from-career-and-family-by-claudia-goldin/">previous work</a>.</p>



<p>In other words, men want to start families, but they don’t face the same obstacles combining employment and parenthood. And women, by and large, want time for both work and children.</p>



<p>By now, birth rates have been in decline, at least in rich nations, for 50 years. So Goldin can’t help but wonder: “Why are we talking about this now?”</p>



<p>She referred to the current, often-heated public discourse around ways to increase birth rates in the U.S. Until we, as a society, address the real underlying causes, Goldin said, “you really can’t address what policies can address the declining fertility rate.”</p>



<p>And the issues, she notes, are not just a concern of the left but bridge the political divide.</p>



<p>“One of the things that is important to know is that traditional women today, evangelical women today still want respect in the workplace,” she said. “They still want to know that they’re being promoted appropriately, that they’re being paid the correct amount. It’s not as if women are eschewing all of the rights that they have gained over time.”</p>



<p>The issue of falling birth rates underlies everything, argued Goldin, who is currently working on a book about women’s rights.</p>



<p>“I’ve written on various aspects of demography,” she said. “About the first <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21263/revisions/w21263.rev0.pdf">declines in infant and child mortality</a> in America and the role of public health and the cleaning up of the nation’s water supply and the separation of the sewage from clean water. I’ve written about why <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24716/w24716.pdf">women live longer than men</a> and whether that’s always been the case.” (The answer is no.)</p>



<p>“The issues concerning the change in population, about families and children, are absolutely fundamental to everything that I do,” concluded Goldin. “I can’t talk about the labor force unless I talk about population.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>For people living with diabetes, caring for their gums can be just as important as managing blood sugar. Research has shown that there is a two-way relationship between periodontal disease — more commonly known as gum disease — and diabetes.</p>



<p>People with periodontitis have a higher risk of diabetes, and patients with diabetes are three times more likely to develop periodontal disease. About 50 percent of adults worldwide are affected by gum disease, contributing to the more than 3.5 billion people impacted by oral diseases each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>



<p>To shed light on this connection, Harvard School of Dental Medicine spoke with David Wu, an instructor in the School’s Department of Oral Medicine, Infection, and Immunity, and program director of the Advanced Graduate Education Program in Periodontology.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-narrow-single-line"/>



<p><strong>Can you explain why people with diabetes are at higher risk for gum disease?</strong></p>



<p>Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for gum disease due to persistently elevated blood sugar levels, which can impair the body’s ability to fight infection and promote chronic inflammation in the mouth. This weakened immune response combined with higher amount of glucose in your saliva allows harmful oral bacteria to flourish and plaque to build up, increasing the likelihood of gum tissue breakdown and periodontal infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1980" height="1320" src="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg" alt="David Wu." class="wp-image-418570" srcset="https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg 1980w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=48,32 48w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=96,64 96w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=1488,992 1488w, https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1980.David-Wu.jpg?resize=1680,1120 1680w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px" /></figure>



<p><strong>What early signs of gum disease should someone with diabetes be aware of?</strong></p>



<p>Early symptoms of gum disease may include gums that are red, swollen, or bleed easily, especially during brushing or flossing. Persistent bad breath, gum tenderness, receding gum lines, and loose teeth can also signal the onset of periodontal problems. These early signs are often painless, but should not be ignored and warrant timely evaluation by a dental professional.</p>



<p><strong>Can treating gum disease help improve diabetes management?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, effective management of gum disease may lead to improvements in blood sugar control. Treating gum disease reduces chronic inflammation in the body, which can enhance the body’s response to insulin and stabilize metabolic health. The key take away is that integrating routine dental care with diabetes management is key to achieving better overall outcomes for patients. Prevention, early diagnosis, and intervention can lead to best clinical outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any recent research findings that have changed how we understand the link between diabetes and oral health?</strong></p>



<p>Recent scientific advances underscore the bidirectional relationship between diabetes and gum disease. New findings indicate that inflammation from periodontal disease can contribute to worsening blood sugar control, while uncontrolled diabetes may fuel oral infection. Studies are also exploring how genetics and the oral microbiome may influence this complex interplay, heralding a new era of collaborative care between dental and medical professionals.</p>



<p><strong>What daily habits or preventive measures are most effective for protecting gum health in people with diabetes?</strong></p>



<p>Adhering to a thorough oral hygiene routine, including twice-daily brushing, daily flossing, and regular dental checkups, is essential to overall health. Optimal blood sugar control, a balanced diet, and avoidance of tobacco products further support gum health.</p>



<p>Consultation with a periodontist (gum specialist), and professional dental hygiene therapy at least twice a year are strongly recommended, as is prompt attention to any oral changes. For patients with diabetes, the periodontist may recommend a maintenance visit every three months to adequately monitor disease status and halt progression.</p>

<p>Rosalie Abella was 4 years old when she learned that her father hadn’t been allowed to practice law in Canada.</p>



<p>“I had no idea what that even meant,” said Abella, the first Jewish woman on the Supreme Court of Canada. “But it galvanized me and committed me to the idea that I would be what he couldn’t be.”</p>



<p>An émigré and child of death camp survivors, Abella faced daunting challenges in becoming one of Canada’s most influential jurists. Now the Samuel and Judith Pisar Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, she lifted barriers for others through her work in labor and disability rights, constitutional law, and human rights jurisprudence.</p>



<p>Abella’s father, Jacob Silberman, was born in Sienno, Poland, and entered Krakow’s Jagiellonian law school in 1930 as one of the few Jewish students in the program.</p>



<p>By the time he graduated, practicing in his home country was no longer an option. The Nazis had taken over, and he and his wife were sent to concentration camps. They both survived, but Silberman’s parents, three younger brothers, and first-born son — Abella’s brother — were killed.</p>



<p>Abella was born in 1946 in a displaced person’s camp in Stuttgart, Germany. Her father taught himself English and was briefly able to practice law alongside American lawyers, helping to develop a system of legal services for displaced people.</p>



<p>The family got the chance to move to Canada in 1950. Silberman assumed he’d be able to practice there, too. He brought letters of reference from the American judges and lawyers he’d worked with, who wrote glowingly about his abilities.</p>



<p>Their endorsements proved meaningless.</p>



<p>“He came home and said, ‘I can’t do it because I’m not a citizen,’” Abella said. The process to get citizenship would take half a decade, and Silberman had a family to support. He became an insurance agent instead.</p>



<p>In the decades that followed, Abella never heard her parents complain about the injustices they had experienced. Instead, they carried a level of optimism and positivity that was sometimes hard for her to comprehend.</p>



<p>“I don’t think I ever saw them angry about anything that happened to them,” Abella said. “It’s amazing when I think about it. They were so grateful for what they had found in Canada that they didn’t dwell on what they had lost.”</p>



<p>They raised their children to carry themselves as if they could achieve anything with enough hard work and determination.</p>



<p>“It was a rigorously programmed life in terms of the unstated expectation that we would do the best we could possibly do,” Abella said. “I never heard them say, ‘Why can’t you do it as well as so-and-so?’ It was always measuring me against my abilities and stretching them as far as they could go.”</p>

<p>Abella liked working hard and asked for extra homework because her parents taught her that education was important. She saw school as the “last meritocracy,” where nobody could hold you back based on race, color, and religion as long as you put in the work.</p>



<p>By the time she graduated from law school, she’d become aware of the barriers for women in the professional world, but she wasn’t daunted. “It was too late because I was already formed,” she said, “and I was formed as someone who was not afraid.”</p>



<p>Abella saw herself as an outsider. She knew she didn’t dress or think like many of her peers in classes and later in courtrooms, being both Jewish and a woman. But she proceeded with her studies as if the differences wouldn’t matter.</p>



<p>“This was Canada, the land of opportunities,” she said, “and if people were willing to give them to me, I was going to grab them — even if people around me were saying, ‘Wait a minute, that isn’t what women are supposed to do.’”</p>



<p>She fell in love with a history professor — Irving Abella — who, like her parents, also didn’t see any reason why a woman shouldn’t pursue the career she wanted.</p>



<p>“The transfer of confidence from my parents believing in me to a husband who believed in me was total luck — kind of, as Bette Midler would say, ‘the wind beneath my wings.’”</p>



<p>Abella didn’t have any end goal in sight, except to be a lawyer — a good one. She was particularly hungry for chances to learn, willing to bypass higher salary and prestige for a job that would broaden her experience.</p>



<p>After starting her career in private practice, she accepted an appointment — when she was pregnant with her second child at 29 — to the Ontario Family Court, becoming the youngest person and the first pregnant woman ever appointed to the bench in Canada.</p>



<p>There she handled cases involving issues such as child protection and young offender proceedings. At times, she would have to determine whether people could keep their children — as she herself thought of her two young sons at home.</p>



<p>“It taught me what the world was for most people,” Abella said, “and it taught me to be open-minded, not to look at court cases as a judge from the top down, and to actually listen to what they were telling you.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--32)">

</blockquote>



<p>She had another chance to listen as the sole commissioner of the Royal Commission on Equality in Employment. Abella held sessions around the country, talking to women, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, and others from under-represented groups about employment barriers. Then she met with business and labor leaders to figure out practical ways to solve the issues.</p>



<p>Her time on the Family Court, and her own upbringing, guided her.</p>



<p>“I was always interested in other people’s stories because mine is so different from anybody else’s that I knew growing up,” she said. “I heard what it felt like to have a different color, to have a different gender. I learned the tenacity of a barrier when you’re disabled. I heard about racism. I heard about things that I had not personally experienced, and that’s what being a judge is: learning to listen and not hearing your own story, but actually hearing their story. For me, it was about fairness”</p>



<p>In the commission’s final report, Abella created a definition of equity in employment that would have far-reaching effects in the Canadian justice system: “Equality means accommodating and acknowledging people’s differences so they can be treated as equals.”</p>



<p>“I just felt it growing up. I felt how unfair it had been that 6 million people who were Jewish were exterminated because they were Jewish,” she said. Her time on the Family Court and working in private practice informed her thinking about balancing group rights, which was about human rights, and the civil libertarian theory of the individual. “I wasn’t aware of any of that in law school,” she said. “It was only my clients and then the family court that made me understand.”</p>



<p>Five years later, in its first decision on equality rights, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the citizenship requirement for lawyers using Abella’s definition. Her father, who died a month before she finished law school, wasn’t able to see her complete the circle, but her mother, Fanny, was.</p>



<p>“I felt so grateful for the fact that she was there on their behalf to see what had happened to the career he launched by not being able to be a lawyer in Canada,” Abella said, “a career that she and my husband nurtured and encouraged.”</p>



<p>Abella brought her ideas on equality to the Ontario Court of Appeals, where she began in 1992, and then to the Supreme Court in 2004.</p>



<p>Though she learned to listen differently — to lawyers instead of from clients directly as she had during Family Court — she made decisions with personal ramifications in mind.</p>



<p>“Every case to me was a novel,” Abella said. “It didn’t matter whether it was copyright or tax or equality or freedom of expression. It was always about how the law affected people.”</p>



<p>Taking this approach meant sometimes finding that the opinion she had formed after days studying the case was wrong. “You have to actually hear what parties are arguing and saying,” she said. “And if you can’t do it with an open mind, you shouldn’t be there — because there’s always a chance that you’re wrong.”</p>



<p>Her willingness to go out on a limb to protect or expand rights — and the jurisprudential status quo — often drew criticism. In 2020’s Fraser v. Canada, Abella’s majority opinion found that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers’ pension plan discriminated against women who needed to reduce hours to take care of children. Some justices and academics disagreed, calling it judicial overreach.</p>



<p>Abella’s attention to the law’s treatment of minority groups drove many similar decisions<strong>.</strong> She wrote the first appellate gay rights rulings and paved the way for marriage equality in Canada, protected workers’ bargaining rights, invented employment equity, and advanced fairness for women and minorities in others.</p>



<p>“There were so many things that caused the public to say, ‘Wait a minute, are we ready for this?’” Abella said. “And it was my view that that’s what you have judges for.” If judges couldn’t make decisions that protected the public interest as opposed to public opinion, “then I don’t think we’re doing our job, and we’re mixing up what elected bodies do with what independent bodies, like the judiciary, do.”</p>



<p>She also credits her husband, Irving, who died in 2022, for encouraging her to ignore the controversies and do what she thought was right. He was excited about Abella’s opportunity to teach at Harvard, as were her two adult sons, both lawyers. “It’s great to have professional satisfaction and respect,” Abella said, “but the core is family.”</p>



<p>All the way, she channeled the lessons she learned from her parents. “They were extraordinary people whose core commitment to integrity was unwavering,” Abella said. “It was important to them that whatever I do, I do with dignity and respect.”</p>



<p>In taking up the career her father was denied, Abella built a legacy all her own.</p>

<p>Steven Schlozman was 11 years old when he watched “Salem’s Lot,” a made-for-TV movie based on the Stephen King book about a Maine town invaded by vampires. He was bitten. After experiencing a “fun kind of scare,” he became a horror fan.</p>



<p>A former assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Schlozman is the author of “The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse” (2011), whose film rights at one time were optioned by the late George Romero, director of the archetypal zombie horror film “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7xO_ciIEeA">Night of the Living Dead</a>” (1968).</p>



<p>In this interview, which has been edited for clarity and length, Schlozman talks about why he believes zombies are the scariest horror trope.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-squares"/>



<p><strong>Can you explain the psychology behind the attraction to horror?</strong></p>



<p>In terms of psychology, there are several theories. There’s the idea that watching a horror movie is experiencing fear in a safe environment, similar to riding a roller coaster. A cognitive explanation is that some people like horror films because they like to figure out what makes them scared. It’s a process of metacognition; it’s thinking about what you’re thinking. Because at the end of the day, you’re sitting in a movie theater, or at home, and there’s nothing really to be afraid of.</p>



<p>There’s also a whole literature on the thrill-seeking temperament. These are folks who get a serotonin or a dopamine rush with the thrill. You don’t really think your life is in danger for something that’s happening on a 2D screen, but the thrill of it makes you feel euphoric. There is also the catharsis theory, which allows us a release of emotions. Lots of studies say that people actually feel calmer and even less sad after watching a horror film.</p>



<p><strong>In a famous </strong><a href="https://www.drmarkwomack.com/pdfs/why_we_crave_horror_movies.pdf"><strong>essay</strong></a><strong>, Stephen King talks about the need for horror movies as a kind of release valve for our worst impulses. What is your take?</strong></p>



<p>We’ve been telling scary stories since we could tell stories. A lot of stories we read in our childhood are scary stories, and who has not enjoyed listening to a scary story around the campfire?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow" style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--64);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--64);padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0">
<p>“We need horror stories because they help us confront our fears, and they allow us to have hard conversations about things that we have a hard time talking about, except in the displacement of a movie. ”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We need horror stories because they help us confront our fears, and they allow us to have hard conversations about things that we have a hard time talking about, except in the displacement of a movie. “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968) deals with the plights of motherhood, “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) and Get Out” (2017) with racism, and “The Babadook” (2014) with trauma and the challenges of having a child who can be difficult to manage. There is also the fear of death, and of the unknown. We fear death because we don’t know what happens after we die. Horror films allow you to deal with fears of what is unknowable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s talk about zombies. Why are zombies more terrifying than vampires, werewolves, or ghosts?</strong></p>



<p>What’s scary about zombies is that they look so much like us; they were humans before they were infected, but they’re not humans anymore. Even if a zombie looks like your grandmother, when she gets close to you, she’ll lunge and bite you, and it’s a done deal. But the really terrifying thing about zombies isn’t that they will bite you and turn you into a zombie; it’s the idea that humans can get robbed of themselves, and that’s really scary. The idea of a person not being themselves, but still recognizable as a person, is a terrifying notion. It’s also what scares us about sick people because if someone is very ill, they stop looking like themselves, or at least they look like a sick version of themselves.</p>



<p><strong>In your novel, you explained in a scientific way what’s going in the brains and bodies of zombies. Can you tell us more?</strong></p>



<p>I wrote a fake medical paper about zombies, and that was the origin of my book. It’s an epistolary novel, which is a series of diary entries or letters, combining real references with fake references. I wanted it to feel real. I wanted it to feel possible. I came up with a fake name for the zombie disease based on its symptoms. I called it Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency Syndrome (ANSD). Ataxic means loss of balance; neurodegenerative refers to the brain’s degradation; satiety deficiency means that the satiety regions of the stomach are no longer functioning, so you just keep eating. And syndrome is just a fancy word in medicine for “We don’t actually know what causes this.”</p>



<p>I explain zombie neurology by pointing at different impaired regions of the zombie brain. When you look at the stumbling ghouls in Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead,” you notice that they have lost their sense of balance, which is located in the basal ganglia. They can’t think very well or even open a window, so there must be something wrong with the frontal lobe. They’re hungry all the time, so their satiety regions are not functioning well. When I wrote the novel, I made the zombie disease to be a result of a manufactured pathogen by people who bet against the market when it plunged. I wrote the book in 2011, and the financial crash of 2008 was still on my mind. In most zombie movies, the bad guy is never the zombies.</p>



<p><strong>George Romero, the film director, praised your novel, and the two of you were working on a screenplay. What happened?</strong></p>



<p>George optioned the film rights for my book. He and I worked on the screenplay together, but no one bought it. Someday, somebody will hopefully buy it. It’s been optioned two more times since then, and it’s never been made. George was a lovely person; we enjoyed spending time with each other. He was a little melancholic about what had happened to zombies, that they have become a video game thing. He wanted to get away from that; he wanted it to be, ultimately, a kind of sad story.</p>



<p><strong>A common Google search asks whether zombies can exist. Can they?</strong></p>



<p>No. In fact, when I was at Harvard, they made me promise, as the director of medical student education in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, to always say that my book was a made-up story, and that zombies cannot exist. There are people who can have injuries to their brains, and they can remind you of these cinematic characters. But we don’t need zombies to do ourselves in as a species.</p>



<p><strong>Another common search asks: If zombies existed, what would be the best way to kill them?</strong></p>



<p>According to Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead,” the ghouls can only be killed through shooting or hitting them in the head. By damaging zombies’ brain, they suffer an interruption of the brainstem, which regulates the brain’s regions that are responsible for all the vital functions such as heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. Only then can you stop them altogether.</p>

<p>Even before the 2024 election, former federal legal officials were concerned about the potential politicization of the Department of Justice during a second Trump administration. But the recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after direct pressure from the president have crossed a red line, said journalist <a href="https://emilybazelon.com/">Emily Bazelon</a>.</p>



<p>“I think crisis is a completely justified word to use,” said Bazelon, a Yale Law School graduate and New York Times Magazine staff writer. “What’s happening now is just an utter dismantling of all the norms and rules that were enacted after Watergate to try to have some separation between the White House’s political aspirations and the Justice Department.”</p>



<p>Bazelon was on campus Monday for the Francis Biddle Memorial Lecture, titled “Has Independence Ended for the Justice Department?” The Truman Capote Fellow for Creative Writing and Law at Yale Law School detailed the reaction within the DOJ and in the wider Washington legal community to White House moves to press for prosecutions of individuals considered Trump’s political enemies.</p>



<p>The department has for decades been assured prosecutorial independence in the wake of the public and congressional backlash against President Richard Nixon’s attempts to use the agency to impede the investigation into the Watergate scandal, she said.</p>



<p>“Presidents have been very careful, for their own political benefit, to separate themselves and to respect these norms and rules that have governed this sort of distancing [between the White House and the DOJ],” said Bazelon. “President Trump just sees it differently, and not entirely, but for the most part, he’s pretty much allowed to do that, at least until the courts stop him, and that, as probably many of you know, just hasn’t happened yet.”</p>



<p>The sense of crisis has been felt within the department, where about 4,000 of the agency’s more than 115,000 employees have resigned and more than 200 have been fired, Bazelon said. There is widespread concern among employees in Washington and at many U.S. attorneys’ offices around the nation about the perceived erosion of the department’s independence.</p>



<p>That view is shared by others in the nation’s legal establishment. In a recent <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2025/10/independence-and-evidence-must-drive-federal-prosecutorial-actions/">statement</a>, the American Bar Association expressed its concern over “the use of federal prosecutorial power for apparent partisan ends,” calling it “an affront to the rule of law.”</p>



<p>The latest indictments emerged after a social media post on Sept. 20 in which Trump demanded that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi prosecute Comey and James.</p>



<p>Both had been involved in separate investigations of Trump. James, the New York attorney general, led a successful civil fraud investigation against the Trump Organization. Comey investigated Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>



<p>James was indicted on charges she made false claims on a mortgage application, and Comey was accused of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Both have denied the charges.</p>



<p>Apprehension over Trump’s likely politicization of the Justice Department was high during his first term, said Bazelon, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/magazine/trump-justice-department-rivals.html">surveyed</a> 50 former federal legal officials in October 2024. A year later, she conducted another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/magazine/legal-experts-trump-justice-department.html">survey</a> with 49 of the original participants, plus an additional one. Half of the participants were Democratic appointees and the other half Republican, but all were alarmed, she said.</p>



<p>“Their level of alarm at this point is basically off the charts, and I ran the survey before the indictments of James Comey and Letitia James started to come down,” said Bazelon. “And when we asked the question, ‘Do you think President Trump is using the Justice Department as a tool of retribution and reward?’ all 50 people said, ‘Yes.’</p>



<p>“People who were very high up in the George W. Bush administration are freaked out,” she said. “People who served in the first Trump administration, mostly off the record, are very freaked out.”</p>



<p>During the survey, participants also remarked on Congress’ lack of response to political interference in the Justice Department. Almost all noted the Supreme Court also has done little or nothing to push back. This stands in contrast to lower court judges, who have ruled against the administration in several cases, only to see their decisions rejected by the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.</p>



<p>The departure of Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who resigned after he declined to pursue criminal charges against James due to lack of evidence, is a warning sign that politically driven prosecutions will continue, said Bazelon.</p>



<p>“Erik Siebert is gone, and Lindsey Halligan, the current person acting as U.S. attorney in Virginia, is an insurance lawyer who has never prosecuted a case before,” said Bazelon. “That is, since Watergate, an unprecedented set of actions happening, and it doesn’t really look like there’s an end in sight to it.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-global-padding is-content-justification-center is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<p>When it comes to American public education, states wield a lot of power over policy — lately, more than they have in decades.</p>



<p>But that influence isn’t always accompanied by insight.</p>



<p>Sometimes, despite valiant efforts, superintendents and commissioners enact sweeping new policies affecting millions of students with little immediate feedback about whether and how they’re working.</p>



<p>Christina Grant knows that struggle: From 2021 to 2024, she served as state superintendent of schools in Washington, D.C. And now she’s part of a University initiative designed to help fill the knowledge gap in partnership with a first cohort of states announced this week.</p>



<p>“It’s very different to be able to look under the hood with a particular policy — where you’re getting answers not in five years, but in a year or a year and a half,” Grant said. “You want to go from hearing about what worked with a particular program to knowing.”</p>



<p>Grant was named executive director of the Center for Education Policy Research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education last June, at a troubled time for American schools. Four years after COVID-19 closed classrooms, test scores and attendance still haven’t returned to their pre-pandemic highs.</p>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/25809062?2555329"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25809062/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>



<p>Along with education economist Thomas Kane, CEPR’s faculty director, Grant began working toward the States Leading States Initiative, <a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu/news/new-states-leading-states-sls-initiative-launched-share-proven-strategies-state-policy">launched</a> in January and backed by a $10 million grant from the Walton Foundation that will sustain it for its first four years.</p>



<p>This week, CEPR announced its first cohort of nine very different states that share a mix of curiosity and practicality about reversing those trends.</p>



<p>“We wanted diversity along a number of different axes. So: big states and small states, states with veteran education leadership and others where a new team is in place — and then diversity of political leadership: red states and blue,” said Scott Sargrad, who will lead the initiative.</p>



<p>Under the program, Harvard’s data analysts will work with state education bureaucracies in Rhode Island and Colorado but also Texas and Tennessee.</p>



<p>Sargrad comes to Harvard after two stints at the U.S. Department of Education, an agency that is facing an <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/04/envisioning-a-country-with-no-department-of-education/">existential threat</a> via an order from President Donald Trump to start closing operations. And that was before the current government shutdown.</p>



<p>With federal oversight of public schools — on the ebb since 2015 —&nbsp;at its lowest point in decades, States Leading States only looks more necessary to Kane.</p>



<p>“There’s a bit of a vacuum — and so the timing could not be better,” said Kane, who will be one educational economist on call for participating state leaders.</p>



<p>The stakes feel incredibly high to Kane: nothing less than “a culture change in K-12 education. We need to recognize that what sounds good on paper doesn’t always work, and that —&nbsp;when it comes to critical questions like lowering absenteeism —&nbsp;you have to be collecting evidence.”</p>



<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/25808683?2555329"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25808683/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>



<p>“I can’t think of anything we could be doing that would make a bigger difference 10 or 20 years from now,” he said.</p>



<p>And the relationship won’t be limited to Zoom calls with CEPR’s offices on Church Street in Cambridge.</p>



<p>Instead, Grant said, “We’ll be placing <a href="https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/data-fellowship">Strategic Data Fellows</a> inside these systems. So those will either be individuals who already work at the departments and they’ll go through our fellowship, or we’re going to work with departments to recruit, select, and place fellows” in those nine states.</p>



<p>The goal is to get beyond the superficial, slow, and suggestive data that sometimes guide education policy&nbsp;and replace them with something like randomized controlled trials — the gold standard for empirical research.</p>



<p>“We want to give our partners more confidence than they could get by looking at simple correlations,” Sargrad said. “‘Scores went up; scores went down’ —&nbsp;that’s something, but it’s not super-convincing.”</p>



<p>Crucially, the policies under study will come from the states themselves. Kane, for instance, expects to lend his expertise to Ohio’s in-school cellphone ban, summer reading and math camps in Alabama, and literacy coaches in Texas.</p>

<p>Tony Sanders,&nbsp;state superintendent of public schools in cohort member Illinois, is already looking forward to that objective inside look — whatever it reveals.</p>



<p>When it comes to policies that affect how children learn, Sanders argued, you have to be ruthlessly self-critical.</p>



<p>To illustrate, he borrowed a <a href="https://blog.x.company/tackle-the-monkey-first-90fd6223e04d">fable</a> from tech entrepreneur Astro Teller.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to teach a monkey how to recite Shakespeare in the park, you need a monkey and you need a pedestal,” Sanders said. “Which do you do first?”</p>



<p>Inevitably, Sanders said, many settle on the simpler task: building the pedestal. But “at the end of the day, if you can’t find a monkey that can recite Shakespeare, all you’ve done is set up a pedestal in the park.”</p>



<p>Sanders already has a list of policies he wants his staff to assess with help from Harvard. Those include the development of a plan for numeracy, or mathematical facility, to travel alongside existing work on literacy, and a cellphone ban supported by Gov. JB Pritzker that’s still being debated by the state’s legislature.</p>



<p>Illinois’ proposed phone ban would likely be less stringent than the one already in force in Ohio&nbsp;—&nbsp;and States Leading States will be outfitted to compare the two. They won’t have to wait long: CEPR staff expect their first early findings on policies to publish next spring.</p>



<p>As a former administrator, Grant admits that there is a level of trust involved in admitting Harvard and its scholars into the workings of a large education bureaucracy, where they’re likely to encounter programs failing to meet their potential alongside ones that work.</p>



<p>“That’s why I’m proud of every single state that signed on,” Grant said. “They don’t want to be making changes that don’t move the needle. They’re excited to know, ‘Am I off-course? And if so, how do I get back on?’”</p>

			Megha Majumdar pushes characters to extremes in follow-up to ‘A Burning’		</h2>

<p>Set in climate-stricken Kolkata in the not-too-distant future, Megha Majumdar’s second novel, “A Guardian and a Thief,” weaves together the stories of two families over the course of a week, each in their own way navigating psychological and moral complexities. “There are two selves who occupy this body,” one of Majumdar’s characters tells us. “There is who I am to strangers, and there is who I am to the people who saw me grow up.”</p>



<p>In this edited interview, Majumdar ’10, who published her debut, “A Burning,” in 2020, discusses how the follow-up —&nbsp;a finalist for this year’s National Book Award in fiction —&nbsp;foregrounds the human heart in conflict with itself.</p>

<p><strong>What inspired “A Guardian and a Thief”?</strong></p>



<p>The book has multiple roots. One thing I was thinking about was love and hope. In a time of crisis, these sentiments we think of as noble and good might gain manifestations which are vicious or mean or sly. Can we still be proud of them in those expressions?</p>



<p>Another place where this book started for me was my hometown, Kolkata, India. It is one of the places most profoundly affected by climate change, and I was thinking about the lived experience of it. When I was reading about increasing heat in Kolkata, I thought back to a childhood experience. I was going to the movie theater to watch “Monsters, Inc.” when it came out. The day was so hot, I remember my shoes sticking to the tar of the road. We can talk about increasing temperatures and heat, but that is what it <em>feels</em> like: Your shoes stick to the road.</p>



<p>So these things were interesting to me — this future world of Kolkata and the moral questions — but I couldn’t make the plot work. I had different characters, a different storyline. Then, in 2021, I had my older son, and my perspective on the book completely changed. I became interested in the point of view of a mother in this crisis. That experience of early parenthood helped me drill down to the emotional core of the book.</p>

<p><strong>The book takes place over the course of a (very eventful) week. How did you use your writing to capture the intensity and the speed at which the story unfolds?</strong></p>



<p>I knew that I wanted something that would feel filled with tension, really taut. And I would need to sustain that energy, that feeling of something having gone very wrong: What is going to happen? What choices will these characters make? I needed a very compressed amount of time where I could sustain that energy and also show things meaningfully changing. A week felt like a good amount of time for that.</p>



<p><strong>Throughout the story, many of the adult characters are lying, not just to one another but also to themselves. Their internal narratives are often at odds with their actions. What is it about a crisis that brings this out in the characters?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a really interesting question. I think that space exists between who we want to be — the principled self that we want to be, that as a matter of self-preservation we must believe we are — and who we turn out to be when we are under pressure. When we feel that resources are scarce, and we must grab what’s available for our loved ones or other people will grab it instead … that space is interesting to me as a novelist. It’s a space of both claiming something and sacrificing something else, a space of gain and of loss. It’s a space where our conception of ourselves is profoundly altered, and do we have the courage to be clear-eyed about who we really are, or must we lie to ourselves in order to protect the image that we have? And, who’s to say which is the true self? Am I my true self now in a time of relative abundance and comfort, or would I be my true self in a condition of crisis and scarcity?</p>



<p><strong>For a reader, it’s easy to try to pit the “guardian” versus the “thief,” but in many ways they are one and the same. There’s a quote from the book about hope: “Hope wasn’t soft or tender. It was mean. It snarled, it fought, it deceived.” How does this book wrestle with a different portrayal of hope than the one we often encounter?</strong></p>



<p>The book is interested in confronting faces of hope and love that might frighten us. Hope and love are far more complex than we might intuitively comprehend. I think the power of those feelings — the force contained in hope and love — is such that we might be driven to do things that we are not proud of; we might be driven to make choices that completely contradict our sense of ourselves as moral beings, as decent neighbors and friends and members of a community. One of the most energizing things in fiction is to encounter complexity and truthfulness in other people’s lives. And I was very struck when I was reading about climate change by how there was so much talk of hope — how we must be hopeful in the face of really grim predictions — and the assumption is that hope is this thing of light. Well, what if it’s not? You can act out of hope and do something that is really harmful to your neighbor. What do you do with that kind of hope?</p>



<p><strong>What do you hope readers will take away from reading the novel?</strong></p>



<p>I took a creative fiction writing class at Harvard with Amy Hempel, and I remember reading an interview with her where she said that she always writes as if the reader is dying to get away from her. And that has always stuck with me. This might sound strange, but I love thinking about how to entertain a reader. So I hope, first of all, that a reader feels engaged in the book and drawn in by the plot. And then at the end of the book, I hope that they sit with the questions that were so important to me in writing it.</p>
