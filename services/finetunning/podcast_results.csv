"If those go well, they’ll move to human trials. “That doesn’t mean that the clinical trial will start tomorrow or this year — and perhaps not even next year — but it does mean that we’ve started the process that we hope will ultimately lead to regulatory clearance to conduct a clinical trial to try to directly correct the root cause of this terrible disease,” he said. “I’m hopeful that we’ll at least have a line of sight to the clinic, that we will know what steps need to be taken to reach patients, within a couple of years. That’s the goal.”
What all this means for Annabel, her parents aren’t sure. Despite her condition, she is a happy 10-year-old who, with her 13-year-old sister, Clara, attends the same D.C.-area school their mother attended. She can read and write — math is not a strong suit — and, with the assistance of an aide, attends classes with children her own age. “She loves life,” Nina said. “She makes things in our life really rewarding and happy, which is quite fabulous.”
AHC is a merciless illness. Nina believes that prime editing is “truly transformative,” a sign of gene editing’s rapid advance and a source of hope for patients. But it may turn out that the earlier a gene-editing therapy is given, the better. Decades of living with the condition takes a toll that even the most successful gene therapy might not be able to reverse. Accordingly, RARE Hope is seeking a potential treatment on more than one front, including through AI-enabled analysis of existing drugs. The larger vision, Nina said, is that Annabel be the inspiration for a relentless effort to help as many patients as possible. “We’re thinking about patients across the age spectrum — and Annabel is growing through that spectrum,” she said. “There are the really young who might benefit the most from a genetic type of therapeutic. Then there are the older patients, who might benefit most from a repurposed drug that minimizes some of the episodes but doesn’t necessarily touch the full range of symptoms. We’ve thought from the beginning that it would be worthwhile to develop many different paths to a better life for patients, and that’s what we’re trying to do.”","Alright everyone, welcome back to Health Frontiers, where we explore the cutting edge of medical science. Today, we're diving into a story that perfectly encapsulates both the incredible advancements in medicine and the relentless hope of families facing rare diseases.

We're talking about Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, or AHC, and the exciting strides being made with gene editing. Specifically, a technique called prime editing is showing truly transformative potential. Now, while we're not talking about human trials starting tomorrow, or even next year, researchers are hopeful for a 'line of sight to the clinic' within a couple of years. This means they've started the crucial process that could lead to regulatory clearance.

This journey is deeply personal for many, including the family of 10-year-old Annabel. She's described as a happy, life-loving child, attending school like any other, despite AHC being a truly merciless illness. Her story underscores a critical point: while gene editing offers immense promise, the earlier it's given, the better. Decades of living with AHC can leave a toll that even the most successful therapy might not reverse.

That's why organizations like RARE Hope are tackling this from multiple angles. They're not just banking on prime editing; they're also exploring AI-enabled analysis to repurpose existing drugs. This layered approach aims to help patients across the entire age spectrum – from the very young who might benefit most from genetic therapies, to older patients who could find relief from repurposed drugs managing symptoms.

It's a relentless effort, inspired by children like Annabel, to forge many different paths to a better life. The road ahead is long, but the dedication and scientific ingenuity offer a beacon of hope for so many. That's all for today on Health Frontiers.

"The solution is then exposed to the air where CO2 binds with it. Next, the liquid flows through a second cell, where it is deactivated, separating the CO2. Finally, the pure carbon dioxide gas is released from the system and sequestered underground while the solution cycles through the process again. “It all flows in a circle,” Sabin says. “The electrochemical cells pass electrons to some of the molecules in the solution. The carbon in the CO2 is electrophilic—it’s drawn to the electrons in the liquid. So, when we pass it through the air contactor and the solution interacts with the atmosphere, CO2 dissolves in it and binds with the molecules that have the extra electrons. Those electrons are removed from the molecules when the solution passes through the second cell, carbon dioxide is released as gas and stored, and the process begins again.”
Sabin says this system is vastly more efficient than current methods of carbon capture, using energy primarily to run current through the cells and run air over the exposed solution. Moreover, it can be scaled up, with large plants housing many units and concentrated in areas with low population density. So, what’s the catch? “The solution right now is sensitive to oxygen and water, which are present in the atmosphere in much greater quantities than CO2,” Sabin says. “Sometimes oxygen, depending on the solution’s properties, will come in and steal the electrons. That’s a problem because then the carbon dioxide won’t want to bind with the molecules in the solution. Water can also come in and decompose some of those molecules.”
The challenge is to find a carbon capture “recipe” of solvent (liquid solution), sorbent (molecules that accrue and shed electrons), and electrolytic additives that can enable the mix to stay stable when exposed to the atmosphere. “The most promising development in this space, in my opinion, was when somebody took a very common sorbent in a certain solvent and they just dropped in a little ethanol,” Sabin says. “It’s just alcohol, the most basic thing. And it completely changed the properties of the sorbent. It made it much more oxygen stable.”
Sabin says that he expects to have a “good enough” recipe for carbon capture within two years. Then he plans to create a prototype—perhaps the size of a large bedroom—to show that it works. His mentor Michael Aziz, the Gene and Tracy Sykes Professor of Materials and Energy Technologies and a faculty associate at the Harvard University Center for the Environment, says that Sabin’s model has “a better chance than most” to make direct air capture cost-efficient. “Electrochemical approaches such as Aaron’s have the advantage of operating at ambient temperature and pressure and being driven only by a voltage swing with carbon-free electrical energy, instead of a thermal swing driven by fuel combustion,” he says. “If the winning recipe is developed over the next year or two and a techno-economic analysis demonstrates its worth, it’s likely to take several years to scale.","Hey everyone, and welcome back to 'Innovate & Inspire,' your weekly dose of groundbreaking science! Today, we're diving into a genuinely exciting development in the fight against climate change: a new, highly efficient method for direct air carbon capture that could be a game-changer.

Imagine a system that literally pulls CO2 out of the air, not with massive heat, but with electricity. That's what Harvard's Aaron Sabin and his team are working on. Their electrochemical process uses a special liquid solution that binds with CO2 from the atmosphere. Then, in a second cell, that CO2 is easily separated and stored, while the solution cycles back for more. It's incredibly elegant, operating at ambient temperatures and pressures, driven by clean electricity rather than burning fuel. This ""circular flow,"" as Sabin describes it, promises vastly more efficiency than current carbon capture methods.

Now, the ""catch"" has been the solution's sensitivity to oxygen and water in the air, which can interfere with the CO2 binding. But here's the brilliant part: researchers found that simply adding a touch of ethanol – yes, just alcohol – can dramatically stabilize the solution, making it much more robust against oxygen. This seemingly small additive completely transformed the sorbent's properties!

Sabin is optimistic, expecting a ""good enough"" recipe within two years, paving the way for a prototype. His mentor, Michael Aziz, believes this electrochemical approach has ""a better chance than most"" to make direct air capture cost-efficient. While scaling this to industrial levels will take several more years, the potential is immense. This blend of clever chemistry and electro-power could be a key piece in our puzzle for a cleaner future. That's all for today, stay curious, and we'll catch you next time on 'Innovate & Inspire'!","You can use any of the following formatting:

[Opening music fades in]

Welcome to ""Energy Future"". Today, we're diving into a groundbreaking solution for carbon capture in the industry. The process involves passing a solution of carbon dioxide through air where it binds with molecules, then through a deactivated cell where it's released as gas, and stored underground.

Sabin explains that this system is more efficient than current methods. It uses energy only to run the cells and air over the solution. The solution is sensitive to oxygen and water, but the key is a ""recipe"" of solvent, sorbent, and electrolytic additives. The most promising is ethanol.

Sabin mentions that he expects a good recipe within two years and plans a prototype. His mentor says it's better than most because it's efficient and operates at ambient conditions.

The solution is scalable, especially with large plants and low population areas. However, challenges like oxygen and water presence in the solution affect the process. Sabin hopes to overcome these challenges soon.
