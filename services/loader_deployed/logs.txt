2025-11-11T10:53:42.445542Z	Since James Geary, adjunct lecturer in public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, encountered his first aphorism at age 8, his love for them has only grown. So much so that in 2005, he published a bestselling book, “The World in a Phrase: A Brief History of the Aphorism.” The book’s second edition comes out this month. In an interview, which has been edited for clarity and length, Geary spoke to the Gazette about the appeal of those short, philosophical phrases, how they differ from slogans or tweets, and why memes can be the new aphorisms. What’s the appeal of aphorisms? Aphorisms are the oldest written art form on the planet, but they’re also the most contemporary. With the rise of social media and short-form communication, in many ways the aphorism has found its perfect technological platform. So much of social media today is just toxic — hot takes, rage posts, and all that kind of stuff — but aphorisms from their beginning, 5,000 years ago in China and Egypt, were mostly philosophical thoughts. They’re often witty and are a very sophisticated form of literature that, unlike so much social media today, is not intended to confirm the opinions you already have, but to challenge and provoke you to think further and deeper. How do aphorisms differ from proverbs, slogans, or tweets? A key component of an aphorism is that it has to be philosophical; it has to make you think. And I don’t mean that it has to be esoteric or impenetrable, but about the ultimate questions in life. Aphorisms help us to examine our own beliefs, practices, and our own biases. They’re kind of a philosophy for daily life. Unlike political or commercial slogans or tweets, aphorisms provide answers to that old philosophical question of how to live a good life. Aphorisms have to be super accessible; you can understand them in a second.

2025-11-11T10:43:41.341618Z	Yes, I do. Usually, usually they come out of the blue, or when I’m writing something else, and an aphorism pops up in my mind. Here are a couple: “Even your disguise reveals you.” “If your expectations are low, you are certain to meet them.” These came out of my classes at the Kennedy School because good advice for writing is good advice for living.
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341612Z	Do you have any aphorisms of your own?
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341609Z	Austrian writer Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach said, “An intelligent woman has millions of born enemies … all the stupid men.” Polish writer Urszula Zybura said, “If the future had known what lay ahead, it would have never come,” which sums up the political history of Central Europe under Soviet rule. American thinkers such as Twain, Benjamin Franklin, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau are concerned with individualism. Thoreau said, “Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.”
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341603Z	Politics is a very common thread in many aphorisms from ancient times until today. An ancient Egyptian ruler passed his wisdom to his child who was going to succeed him by saying, “To rule is to know how to be ruled.” And then you have Stanisław Jerzy Lec, a Polish dissident who lived under Soviet rule, who wrote, “Politics: A Trojan horse race.” Daily life is a big theme along with love, friendship, relationships, and money. Mark Twain said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341599Z	What’s the common thread among aphorists across eras? What are they preoccupied with?
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341596Z	Memes are the next step in the evolution of the aphorism. But I wouldn’t say every meme is an aphorism, just like every tweet is not an aphorism. Even if it’s a meme or a visual textual combination, it should still have a twist, it should still be philosophical. The vast majority of memes or tweets are not aphorisms, but the aphorism is adapting to a newly accessible form of communication, which is visual, not only textual.
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341592Z	Aphorisms can work with visual or textual signs, or it can be a combination. Clet Abraham, for example, uses no words in his visual aphorisms; he takes street signs and twists them to bring out a philosophical meaning. Shilpa Gupta uses text, but she puts the text into the environment so it feels like you’re walking past an aphorism. Xu Bing, the Chinese artist, uses language but kind of distorts it, playing with the ways in which we perceive images and the way we understand language.
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341588Z	Since memes appeared on the scene, I realized that aphorisms don’t have to involve language.
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341585Z	You say in your book that memes are the new form of aphorism. How so?
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341582Z	“Aphorisms have to be super accessible; you can understand them in a second. And they often feature a twist that upends expectations.”
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341579Z	Aphorisms have to be super accessible; you can understand them in a second. And they often feature a twist that upends expectations. Mae West, a famous American actress from the 1940s, said, “It’s not the men in my life that count; it’s the life in my men.” Or JFK’s “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” Or French writer Nicolas Chamfort’s “Society is composed of two great classes: those who have more appetite than dinners, and those who have more dinners than appetite.” Their mode of delivery is brief, but the impact of a really good aphorism is long-lasting; they are in your head for a lifetime. I first encountered the aphorism “The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth” when I was 8 years old, and it has never left my mind.
2025-11-11T10:43:41.341574Z	A key component of an aphorism is that it has to be philosophical; it has to make you think.

2025-11-11T10:43:41.341455Z	As dog owners can attest, different breeds exhibit stark differences in behavior and temperament. Researchers uncovered wide variability in baseline levels of fear and aggression among different breeds. For example, breeds that specialized in guarding livestock or bringing down big game were more prone to aggression. Within each breed, researchers reported that puppyhood trauma had measurable effects: Animals with histories of adversity displayed greater fear and aggression than other members of the same breeds. These experiences were at least as influential as other factors such as sex and whether the animal had been neutered. The impacts were most dramatic in breeds such as American Eskimo Dogs, American Leopard Hounds, and Siberian Huskies. On other hand, Labradors showed relatively little effects. More than half the dogs in the survey came from single breeds.
2025-11-11T10:42:34.037283Z	The research was conducted in the lab of Erin Hecht, an assistant professor in Human Evolutionary Biology and a prominent researcher of canine biology, evolution, and domestication. Espinosa collected data on 4,497 dogs by having their owners fill out a survey that covered whether the animals had been subjected to harsh punishments such as beatings, having their mouths held shut, or being pinned down by humans seeking to assert dominance (the so-called “alpha roll”). The survey also asked whether the dogs had gone through traumatic events such as living on the streets, being attacked by other dogs, or getting hit by cars. “We know that the nervous system is especially plastic early in life,” said Hecht. “In this study, we found that in dogs, traumatic experiences during the first six months had the biggest impact on their fear and aggression behavior later in life. “This lines up with what we’ve seen in humans and in other animals — there’s this critical period of development when the nervous system is more sensitive and impacts during that time can have bigger effects.”

Now, a study by Harvard scientists links early adversity to similar effects in our oldest domesticated species. In a study of nearly 4,500 dogs published in Scientific Reports, researchers found that adverse experiences in the first six months of puppyhood were strongly associated with elevated aggression and fearfulness in adult dogs. “In the general population of dogs, you see a significant impact of life experience on behavior,” said Julia Espinosa, lead author of the new study and a research associate in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB). “What we found that was really surprising is that this impact varies by the breed of the dog, so that suggests there’s an important heritable component to behavior and individual susceptibility to stress.”

2025-11-11T10:42:34.037129Z	Gertner believes that mandatory retirement age for judges, including Supreme Court justices, would help avoid public debates about cognitive decline and also help the court regain some public support, which has dropped to “near historic lows,” according to a recent Pew report. “I stand for retirement age, particularly for the Supreme Court justices,” said Gertner. “There is another generation coming down the pipe … and the retirement age should address the issue of cognition, but also the issue of democratic legitimacy.”
2025-11-11T10:42:34.037122Z	Gertner retired at 65 in 2011 to pursue other career options, including teaching and writing. She says imposing a retirement age on judges would ultimately be more effective, although she echoed the notion of the complications in setting one. Individualized cognitive assessments might pose risks in implementation due to potential bias, but also because there isn’t agreement on how to assess cognitive impairment in judges, she said. “If we don’t have an agreement on what comprises cognitive decline, I’m not sure that I feel comfortable about a cognitive test,” said Gertner. “What is the marker of individualized decline in our incredibly divided world, where judges are under attack?”
2025-11-11T10:42:34.037113Z	Worldwide, most countries have either a compulsory retirement age for justices in their highest court — which ranges from 60 to 75 years — or term limits. To address the issue of aging politicians, Shen discussed the possibility of a mandatory disclosure of cognitive assessments, similar to financial disclosures, to provide voters with additional information. Benjamin C. Silverman, assistant professor of psychiatry and member of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, highlighted the difficulties in assessing cognitive impairment, including the vast individual variation in cognitive decline, the variability in cognitive reserve among individuals, and the lack of a baseline neurocognitive functioning assessment. “The biggest challenge to assessing cognitive impairment is lacking a baseline assessment,” said Silverman. “As we get older, if we display some sort of cognitive challenges, someone might say, ‘Let’s do some neuropsychological testing,’ but without the ability to compare that to something, without being able to see a trajectory, it’s really hard to know what to do with it.”
2025-11-11T10:42:34.037104Z	“The upside of that is that it’s administratively very easy. All you need is a birth certificate and a calculator,” Shen said. “The second upside is you reduce, though not entirely, some concerns about cognitive decline in older ages.”

In the case of aging judges, some states have tackled the issue already. Thirty-two of 50 impose a mandatory retirement age, according to an article by the National Center for State Courts.

2025-11-11T10:41:42.436401Z	Gertner believes that mandatory retirement age for judges, including Supreme Court justices, would help avoid public debates about cognitive decline and also help the court regain some public support, which has dropped to “near historic lows,” according to a recent Pew report.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436397Z	“If we don’t have an agreement on what comprises cognitive decline, I’m not sure that I feel comfortable about a cognitive test,” said Gertner. “What is the marker of individualized decline in our incredibly divided world, where judges are under attack?”
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436392Z	Individualized cognitive assessments might pose risks in implementation due to potential bias, but also because there isn’t agreement on how to assess cognitive impairment in judges, she said.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436388Z	Gertner retired at 65 in 2011 to pursue other career options, including teaching and writing. She says imposing a retirement age on judges would ultimately be more effective, although she echoed the notion of the complications in setting one.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436384Z	“The biggest challenge to assessing cognitive impairment is lacking a baseline assessment,” said Silverman. “As we get older, if we display some sort of cognitive challenges, someone might say, ‘Let’s do some neuropsychological testing,’ but without the ability to compare that to something, without being able to see a trajectory, it’s really hard to know what to do with it.”
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436379Z	Benjamin C. Silverman, assistant professor of psychiatry and member of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, highlighted the difficulties in assessing cognitive impairment, including the vast individual variation in cognitive decline, the variability in cognitive reserve among individuals, and the lack of a baseline neurocognitive functioning assessment.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436374Z	To address the issue of aging politicians, Shen discussed the possibility of a mandatory disclosure of cognitive assessments, similar to financial disclosures, to provide voters with additional information.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436369Z	Worldwide, most countries have either a compulsory retirement age for justices in their highest court — which ranges from 60 to 75 years — or term limits.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436364Z	“The upside of that is that it’s administratively very easy. All you need is a birth certificate and a calculator,” Shen said. “The second upside is you reduce, though not entirely, some concerns about cognitive decline in older ages.”
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436360Z	In the case of aging judges, some states have tackled the issue already. Thirty-two of 50 impose a mandatory retirement age, according to an article by the National Center for State Courts.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436355Z	“There are more people in Congress who are older than ever before,” said Shen, who moderated the event.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436351Z	During his remarks, Francis X. Shen, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, and member of Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics, pointed to a New York Times article that reported that more than a fifth of members of Congress are 70 years old and older.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436346Z	The U.S. Constitution sets 35 as the minimum age for president, 30 for senators, and 25 for representatives, but it does not set a maximum age limit. The document specifies neither minimum nor maximum age for Supreme Court justices.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436341Z	Most Americans support age limits for both politicians and Supreme Court justices, according to a report from the Pew Research Center, but that would require a constitutional amendment.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436336Z	According to the Federal Judicial Center, in 2024, the average age of U.S. federal judges was 67.68 years.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436331Z	On the Supreme Court, Justices Clarence Thomas (77) and Samuel Alito (75) are the most senior on the bench, followed by Sonia Sotomayor (71) and Chief Justice John Roberts (70).
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436327Z	Both Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the House were led until recently by octogenarians; Republican Senator Mitch O’Connell announced his retirement on his 83rd birthday, and Democratic Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi will be 86 at the end of her term in 2027. The average age of a member of Congress is about 59.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436322Z	The issue is widespread.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436317Z	Questions about the graying of the nation’s leaders became a major campaign issue in recent elections, most notably in the races for the nation’s commander in chief. Former president Joe Biden was 82 at the end of his presidency, and Donald Trump, at 78, became the oldest person to be inaugurated as president for his second term.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436310Z	“There may well be, particularly now, a movement to have age limits or term limits for judges,” said retired federal judge Nancy Gertner, senior lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School, at the event sponsored by the Petrie-Flom Center. “They exist everywhere else in the world and in the majority of states. The Supreme Court’s lack of either an age limit or a term limit is really unusual.”
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436302Z	That could be ripe for a change as concerns increase over cognitive decline among aging leaders and jurists, said experts during a Wednesday panel titled “How Old is Too Old to Govern?”
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436295Z	Many professions come with mandatory retirement ages but not so for federal judges and lawmakers, with many remaining on the job well into their 70s and 80s.
2025-11-11T10:41:42.436290Z	Americans seem to mostly say yes; legal, medical scholars point to complexities of setting limits

2025-11-10T22:09:19.702149Z	The lecture, part of the division’s yearlong 50th anniversary celebration, is expected to be an annual signature event hosted by the division to foster community and discussion on thought-provoking topics, said DCE Dean Nancy Coleman.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238956Z	Gilbert shared that he dropped out of high school at 16. He later found his way back to education through continuing studies and never imagined he would one day be on stage at Harvard. “Those opportunities allowed me to imagine a future that was very different than the one I was getting prepared for,” he told the audience.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238950Z	For ages happiness was often seen as a matter of luck. Gilbert noted that because of advances in agriculture, industry, and technology, many people today live longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives than their ancestors could have imagined. “For the very first time, human happiness is not just in the hands of fate,” he said. “To a large extent, your happiness is under your control.”
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238945Z	“Children can be a great source of happiness,” Gilbert said, “but they can also be a great source of stress and hard work. Whether they increase or decrease happiness depends on how those two things balance out.”
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238939Z	The third ingredient in Gilbert’s mother’s “recipe” — having children — proved to be a more complex data point. While many parents describe their children as their greatest source of joy, Gilbert pointed to data showing that, on average, parents report less happiness while raising kids. The effect is particularly pronounced for young, single mothers, while older, married fathers tend to report the largest boosts.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238934Z	“Trading time with people you love for money that won’t do anything for your happiness is a very bad deal,” Gilbert said.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238929Z	However, research shows that the relationship between money and happiness follows a flattening curve: People at lower levels of wealth became very happy the more money they made, but happiness tended to decrease once their finances reached a certain high point. Gilbert cited work by Nobel Prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, who found that increasing social connections often outweighed massive financial gain. Their 2010 study revealed that the mood boost from spending a day with loved ones was seven times larger than the boost from quadrupling annual income.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238923Z	Turning to income, Gilbert debunked the ancient notion that money and happiness are unrelated. “When people are hungry, cold, or sick, they are not happy,” he said. “Money absolutely makes people happy — because it buys them out of almost every form of human misery.”
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238918Z	According to Gilbert, his mother may have been partly right — at least when it comes to marriage. Studies have shown that married people are on average happier than those who are unmarried, and the effect holds across decades of data. But he added, “It isn’t marriage, per se, that makes you happy. It’s the good marriage you have. If a marriage is good enough to keep, you’ll likely get a happiness boost from keeping it. If it isn’t, you’ll likely get one from leaving.”
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238912Z	“I thought my mom’s recipe for happiness was original,” said the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology, “but then I became a scientist and discovered that everybody’s mom had this recipe.”
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238907Z	Last week the social psychologist broke down what the science says about his mother’s three-pronged formula — marriage, money, and children — during the Division of Continuing Education’s inaugural Dean’s Distinguished Lecture in Sanders Theatre.
2025-11-10T22:09:17.238902Z	Daniel Gilbert’s mother gave him some advice many years ago on finding happiness.

2025-11-10T22:09:17.238858Z	Agüera y Arcas views intelligence as the ability to predict and influence the future and traces the “human intelligence explosion” to the moment when humans formed societies and began cooperating and living together. He argues the growth and evolution of human brains began when they banded together and created collective societies. The emergence of societies was a major evolutionary transition, he said, citing the work of scientists Eörs Szathmáry and John Maynard Smith. “Human individuals are not very smart, but when we get together, we can do amazing things, like transplanting organs and going to the moon,” said Agüera y Arcas. “Those are not individual capabilities.

The root programming language used only eight basic instructions, but after a few million interactions among the random bytes more complex programs began to appear because they became self-reproducing — and grew in complexity. “It was an exploration of how self-reproducing entities can arise out of random initial conditions, which is how life must have arisen, right?” said Agüera y Arcas.

2025-11-10T22:09:17.238819Z	Agüera y Arcas’ book explores the evolution and social origins of intelligence and develops his insights on what he calls the computational nature of intelligence, biology, and life as a whole. It draws on ideas from scientists such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann and their theories on self-replication and universal computation, as well as evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis’ theory of symbiogenesis and Agüera y Arcas’ own research and experiments at Google. Agüera y Arcas used Margulis’ theory, which suggests that merging different organisms to form more complex entities played a key role in cell evolution, to explain the similarities between the computational aspects of both biology and AI models, which also engage in symbiotic relationships of cooperation and develop greater complexity and intelligence. Charles Darwin’s evolution theory of random mutation and natural selection is only half the evolution story, Agüera y Arcas said; symbiogenesis, with cooperation as its main feature, is the creative engine behind evolution. “Life was computational from the start,” said Agüera y Arcas. “It gets more computationally complex over time through symbiogenesis because when you have two computers that come together and start cooperating, now you have a parallel computer, and a massively parallel computation that leads to more and more parallel computation, which is exactly what we see in nervous systems that consist of lots of neurons that are all computing functions in parallel.”

Ultimately, human beings are creative creatures. We create rhythm, poetry, and music to communicate something deeper than rigid words. AI in music threatens that creativity, causing ethical and legal problems for creators and consumers. While we have always integrated technology into our lives, are we reaching a point where that technology is depriving us of something innate to our being. As the conversations around AI continue to expand, we are only set to encounter more challenges. And so, while machines may be able to make music, only humans can make it matter.

AI music transgresses these boundaries because AI can be trained on existing work without any protections in place. The average artist might fear that their work will be plagiarized by AI at any given moment. Using AI to filter out voices, grainy vocals on the last track The Beatles played together were restored to release the official song “Now and Then.” Though the Beatles have control over their own voice, the same cannot be said for the average artist, who likely lacks the funds to fight copyright battles. AI companies, like Suno, have outright stated that their AI tools train on copyrighted material and might regurgitate such material. However in their view, that is simply how the music industry is set to evolve.

2025-11-10T22:09:15.186494Z	Beats by AI is not the only AI artist receiving attention. AI-created artist Xania Monet signed a multi-million dollar deal after Billboard chart success with their gospel song “Let Go, Let God.” Xania Monet has sparked much controversy, with many reflecting on what this means for creativity and artistry. Popular singer Kehlani laments on the state of the industry, believing that up and coming artists will only struggle to break into the mainstream bubble all the more with computer programs having a place in the limelight. Similarly, global star SZA states that she ‘'hates AI” and detests those that feed her likeness to AI programs to create content. Music is an especially controversial field for the integration of AI. AI can generate songs and aid lyrical development, mastering production, voice cloning, and more. AI can streamline the entire process to where all a person has to do is provide a prompt. In advertisements, AI can generate promotional content of music artists using their likeness. In creation, artists can use services like AI music company Suno to create AI songs in mere seconds. For financially challenged artists, the proliferation of AI services provides a way to democratize the often expensive process of creating music. Similarly, if anyone can create music, detached from the creative process, smaller artists face the risk of being buried in the torrent of songs. Why would record companies invest in artists if they can create hit songs for a fraction of the price? For consumers, this introduces the larger question about the integrity of the art created. Being a fan is a uniquely human connection — why else do people camp outside in storming conditions to interact with their favorite musical artist? When such consumers are fed music created by AI, they lose the essence of their obsession: human authenticity. When the song “Heart on My Sleeve” first dropped, which sounded like a collaboration between global superstars Drake and The Weeknd, fans went ballistic, assuming that an album was on the way. Once the song was revealed to be created by a TikToker using AI voice imitation, fans reeled, feeling duped. The song’s creation was removed from the human beings it was supposed to represent. This is the core of the conversation: Can it even be said to be art without human beings involved in the creative process every step of the way? Conversely, there are artists like Grimes, who are choosing to embrace AI in the creative process, believing that AI is a gift that ought to be utilized like any other. Aside from ethical considerations, there are various legal intricacies.

The song is an explicit parody of modern day country music, so much so that TikTok users have started a trend of playing the song for their parents, filming their reactions for the internet to laugh at. More shocking than the lyrics are their creator: an artificial intelligence-powered software program.

Medical science today is unmatched in terms of treating pathogens, restoring health. But to stop disease, you have to do more than that. It’s important to address longstanding social, economic, and political problems with structural solutions. These include programs to reduce the shame of having a disease so that we can increase the number of people being tested. We’re not going to “solve” poverty, but things like cash transfers could provide sex workers with the capital to invest in less risky businesses. Peer education could also empower them to negotiate for condoms in their work.

It can force, for instance, women into commercial sexual activities where they lack the authority to negotiate for condom use, in situations where they get more money if they have condomless sex. Social factors are also important. People can be afraid to be tested still, particularly in conservative societies where they feel they’ll be discriminated against. When they do test positive, some are reluctant to reveal the names of their partners. Government neglect plays a role by not consistently prioritizing funding for elimination programs and cutting funding for programs like USAID (United States Agency for International Development).

2025-11-10T22:08:03.585819Z	These new aspects change the task at hand of eliminating the epidemic that has changed after you first tried to solve it. Is it really futile to think you can end these epidemics? I think that you can come close to ending some of them. Very few of them have indeed ended, like smallpox. But most often, an epidemic persists, often along socioeconomic divides and in a different sort of capacity. For instance, most people now consider COVID a thing of the past, no longer a problem. But it still kills over 2,000 people a month around the world and can cause severe disease in the elderly or infirm. Before treatment was available in the 20th century, syphilis was a significant cause of disability and deformity: blindness, strokes, loss of memory, things that aren’t seen that often anymore. Similarly, AIDS almost always progressed to death within three years after diagnosis. They were terrible deaths where people would walk around appearing emaciated and withdrawn. And these were people in the prime of their lives who had productive roles in society as wage earners for families or workers in factories or agriculture and or schools. The impacts of these epidemics went way beyond the individual. They impacted families, communities, education, and nations. Developing countries became weaker because of the loss of economic productivity and of troops able to serve in the military. Syphilis became treatable early in the 19th century, but particularly so in the 1940s, with the advent of penicillin, a safer drug that was a one-shot cure. The emergence of anti-retrovirals in the 1990s as a treatment for AIDS was seen as almost a miracle. They not only prevented death but also restored people to health. People looked at these drugs euphorically: “We’re going to cure the individual and eliminate the disease from the population.”

We were never able to reach the necessary amount of vaccine uptake because of this mistrust, which also extended to behaviors like social distancing and masking up.
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585756Z	I’ve already mentioned COVID. There are presently about eight million new cases of syphilis a year globally. There are 39 million people worldwide living with AIDS, which still kills about 630,000 a year.
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585750Z	Syphilis became treatable early in the 19th century, but particularly so in the 1940s, with the advent of penicillin, a safer drug that was a one-shot cure. The emergence of anti-retrovirals in the 1990s as a treatment for AIDS was seen as almost a miracle. They not only prevented death but also restored people to health. People looked at these drugs euphorically: “We’re going to cure the individual and eliminate the disease from the population.”
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585744Z	Before treatment was available in the 20th century, syphilis was a significant cause of disability and deformity: blindness, strokes, loss of memory, things that aren’t seen that often anymore. Similarly, AIDS almost always progressed to death within three years after diagnosis. They were terrible deaths where people would walk around appearing emaciated and withdrawn. And these were people in the prime of their lives who had productive roles in society as wage earners for families or workers in factories or agriculture and or schools. The impacts of these epidemics went way beyond the individual. They impacted families, communities, education, and nations. Developing countries became weaker because of the loss of economic productivity and of troops able to serve in the military.
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585736Z	Is it really futile to think you can end these epidemics? I think that you can come close to ending some of them. Very few of them have indeed ended, like smallpox. But most often, an epidemic persists, often along socioeconomic divides and in a different sort of capacity. For instance, most people now consider COVID a thing of the past, no longer a problem. But it still kills over 2,000 people a month around the world and can cause severe disease in the elderly or infirm.
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585730Z	I chose the Hydra because the ways that the pandemics persist or recur are different than when they first start. Either the pathogens become resistant, or there’s some new issue, like problems with trust in science. These new aspects change the task at hand of eliminating the epidemic that has changed after you first tried to solve it.
2025-11-10T22:08:03.585724Z	Powel Kazanjian, AM ’02, is a professor of history and internal medicine (infectious diseases) at the University of Michigan and the author ofPersisting Pandemics. In the book, he draws on his training in both medicine and the humanities to explore why diseases like syphilis, AIDS, and COVID-19 continue to afflict populations despite major biomedical advances. Kazanjian argues that public health efforts fall short when they fail to address the persistent social, political, and economic inequalities that shape how pandemics unfold and endure.

2025-11-10T22:06:24.885022Z	CELEBRATED: The evening will also see the gridiron dedicated as Tim Murphy Field at Harvard Stadium, named for the Crimson’s iconic coach who retired in 2023 after 30 years on the Harvard sideline. THE SCORE BY QUARTERS
2025-11-10T22:06:24.885016Z	You’ve got to love that about coaches: they win by 52 yet they can always find things to work on. FOR OPENERS: Harvard is now 124-25-2 all-time in season openers. The Crimson is 20-4 in its last 24 openers and has a five-game winning streak. Harvard’s last opening-game loss came in 2019, 31-23 at San Diego. FUZZY MATH: This is the 151st season of Harvard football but the 152nd year—the discrepancy courtesy of the 2020 season that was cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. COMING UP: Next Saturday, the Crimson returns to Cambridge for the home and Ivy opener against Brown. Kickoff: 6 p.m. The game will be telecast on ESPN+ and broadcast on radio 92.9 FM WBOS and 1330 AM and 1450 AM. The Bears are 1-0 and will also be playing their Ivy opener. In a series that began in 1893, Harvard leads 90-31-2, but last year in Providence Brown broke a 12-game Crimson winning streak with a 31-28 upset—the Bears’ only Ivy victory of the season. (Go figure!)
2025-11-10T22:06:24.885009Z	We didn’t tackle as well as we should, but we got every guy that was here other than a couple of the quarterbacks into the game. Those young guys will be able to watch themselves on tape and see the corrections they need to make because we need to build depth…We got out healthy, so we can go back and get ourselves ready for Brown.”
2025-11-10T22:06:24.885004Z	Chunk Number 10: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884998Z	“We weren’t detailed enough.

2025-11-10T22:06:24.884988Z	In the second half, Stetson showed some fight, albeit against a defense larded with Crimson reserves. In the third quarter, Alexander engineered a 12-play, 75-yard drive that culminated in the 30-yard touchdown toss to Dempsey. Daniel Holbrook kicked the extra point. Harvard 45, Stetson 7. Junior Dante Torres replaced Craig at quarterback. Torres was intercepted by the Hatters’ Trey Lockhart, who brought the ball to the Harvard 24. But the Crimson defense forced Stetson to settle for a field goal—which was blocked by Harvard senior linebacker Jack Kirkwood. The Crimson took over at its 30. The ensuing drive was sparked by receptions and runs by Harris. With the ball down to the Stetson five, Torres took the snap, surveyed the scene, and sauntered right into the end zone. Fingersh kicked: Harvard 52, Stetson 7. The coup de grace came in the fourth quarter and belonged to sophomore back DJ Gordon, who twisted, spun, and pinballed off would-be tacklers on his way to a 27-yard touchdown. Fingersh dotted the i: Harvard 59, Stetson 7. “The second half we made a lot of substitutions, but we didn’t execute at the same level [as the first],” said Aurich.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884981Z	(If you’re wondering whether the 45 points in a half was a team record…not quite. In 2012, the Crimson scored 49 points in the first half of a 52-3 win over Holy Cross.)
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884976Z	Chunk Number 8: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884970Z	The second period began. After another Hatters three-and-out, the Crimson took over at its 45. Facing a fourth-and-eight at the Stetson 40, Aurich decided to go for it and was rewarded when Craig connected with senior wideout Dean Boyd for 17 yards. Four plays later, sophomore running back Maddux Reid barged in from the two. Fingersh booted. Harvard 35, Stetson 0. On Stetson’s ensuing series, a second-down pass by Hatters quarterback Gavin Rupp was picked off by Henderson at the Stetson 40. The Crimson reached the Hatters 12, but this time they stalled. Displaying no fatigue, Fingersh booted a 29-yard field goal. Harvard 38, Stetson 0. With 2:06 left before halftime, the Crimson got the ball at the Hatters 45. Junior running back Jordan Harris made a nifty 16-yard run. On the next play, Boyd beat the Stetson defensive back and Craig found him for a score. Fingersh converted. Harvard 45, Stetson 0. Craig’s day was done. In a sharp outing, he completed 10 passes in 13 attempts for 208 yards and two touchdowns.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884962Z	Fingersh again kicked. Harvard 21, Stetson 0. The Hatters got the ball—not for long. From the Stetson 25, Alexander completed a pass to Dylan Redmon. Crimson senior defensive back and captain Ty Bartrum hit Redmon, forcing a fumble. Harvard junior defensive back Damien Henderson scooped it up and advanced the ball to the Stetson seven. From there it took four downs, but Bullock eventually barreled over from the three. Fingersh swung his leg, again. Harvard 28, Stetson 0. (If you’re wondering if this is a team record for one quarter…not quite. Harvard scored 31 points in the first quarter of a 59-0 blowout of Bucknell in 1968…the season of “Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29.”)

2025-11-10T22:06:24.884949Z	After the Crimson defense forced a three-and-out, Stetson punted to the Harvard 31. On the first play, Craig took the snap and faked a handoff to freeze prospective rushers. With perfect protection, he spotted freshman wide receiver Ryan Tattersall streaking downfield behind the defense. Craig cocked and fired. The ball arced in a glorious rainbow that Tattersall snagged in stride. Then he ran into the end zone.

2025-11-10T22:06:24.884927Z	Chunk Number 5: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884919Z	Taking advantage of the short field, the Crimson took only six plays to get into the end zone. The final two were a 20-yard run off left tackle by junior Xaviah Bascon, the Crimson’s most seasoned running back, after which Bascon churned his way 11 yards into the end zone. Sophomore Dylan Fingersh kicked the extra point. With 3:04 gone in the season, it was Harvard 7, Stetson 0. The next time the Crimson had the ball, it reached the Stetson 12 before fumbling. The drive was halted—for one play. The Hatters returned the favor, with Harvard sophomore defensive lineman Christian Nwosu falling on the Stetson fumble. Now it was senior running back Isaiah Bullock’s turn to carry the freight.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884913Z	Chunk Number 4: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884907Z	Right from the get-go things went south for Stetson. During the opening kickoff, the Hatters tried an onside kick. Nice idea, poor execution. Harvard recovered at the Stetson 45.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884900Z	The offensive line was doing the same thing. Jaden did a really good job, mixing the ball around and executing.”
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884896Z	Chunk Number 3: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884889Z	Best of all, nobody got hurt. In sum, there was a lot to like for Andrew Aurich as he commenced his second season as Stephenson family head coach for Harvard football. “I was really happy with the first half,” said Aurich. “I thought we executed at a really high level other than one fumble.” (Aurich does have a thing about ball security.) “Our defense was playing at a really high level; I thought we did a good job owning the line of scrimmage.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884884Z	Chunk Number 2: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884876Z	The offensive and defensive fronts controlled the line of scrimmage. Senior linebacker Jaeden Kinlock was everywhere, piling up a game-high 11 tackles.
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884871Z	Chunk Number 1: 
2025-11-10T22:06:24.884863Z	On Saturday, in the middle of the third quarter at Spec Martin Memorial Stadium in DeLand, Florida, history was made. When Stetson University quarterback Kael Alexander rolled left and tossed a pass to wide receiver Michael Dempsey in the end zone, Florida schools broke a 103-year scoreless streak against Harvard. Unfortunately for the Hatters, that made the score: Harvard 45, Stetson 7. Playing the opener of its 151st season, the Crimson tacked on two more touchdowns and cruised to a 59-7 victory. Overmatched Stetson dropped to 1-3. Last year in Cambridge, Harvard had shut out the Hatters 35-0. (In a different time, Harvard had blanked Florida 24-0 in 1922 and whitewashed the Gators 14-0 in 1929). Join thousands of Harvard Magazine readers getting the top Harvard stories in their inbox every Friday. Saturday’s Stetson-Harvard game served as a nice tune-up for Harvard, a soft opening. The Crimson outgained the Hatters 473 yards to 205. Touted senior quarterback Jaden Craig looked sharp, completing 10 of the 13 pass attempts for 208 yards and two touchdowns. New running backs strutted their stuff, while receivers auditioned to be Craig’s No. 1 target.

2025-11-10T22:06:14.585743Z	In sum, there was a lot to like for Andrew Aurich as he commenced his second season as Stephenson family head coach for Harvard football. “I was really happy with the first half,” said Aurich. “I thought we executed at a really high level other than one fumble.” (Aurich does have a thing about ball security.) “Our defense was playing at a really high level; I thought we did a good job owning the line of scrimmage. The offensive line was doing the same thing. Jaden did a really good job, mixing the ball around and executing.”
2025-11-10T22:06:14.585736Z	Saturday’s Stetson-Harvard game served as a nice tune-up for Harvard, a soft opening. The Crimson outgained the Hatters 473 yards to 205. Touted senior quarterback Jaden Craig looked sharp, completing 10 of the 13 pass attempts for 208 yards and two touchdowns. New running backs strutted their stuff, while receivers auditioned to be Craig’s No. 1 target. The offensive and defensive fronts controlled the line of scrimmage. Senior linebacker Jaeden Kinlock was everywhere, piling up a game-high 11 tackles. Best of all, nobody got hurt.

2025-11-10T22:06:14.585723Z	Playing the opener of its 151st season, the Crimson tacked on two more touchdowns and cruised to a 59-7 victory. Overmatched Stetson dropped to 1-3. Last year in Cambridge, Harvard had shut out the Hatters 35-0. (In a different time, Harvard had blanked Florida 24-0 in 1922 and whitewashed the Gators 14-0 in 1929).
2025-11-10T22:06:14.585717Z	Unfortunately for the Hatters, that made the score: Harvard 45, Stetson 7.
2025-11-10T22:06:14.585712Z	On Saturday, in the middle of the third quarter at Spec Martin Memorial Stadium in DeLand, Florida, history was made. When Stetson University quarterback Kael Alexander rolled left and tossed a pass to wide receiver Michael Dempsey in the end zone, Florida schools broke a 103-year scoreless streak against Harvard.

2025-11-10T22:06:14.585630Z	The Hispanic vote proved another lightning rod, with multiple panelists drawing on the 2024 election for evidence of historic realignment. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in 2026, just because of the general nature of midterm elections, you see a lot of the gains Republicans made with Hispanic voters slide back,” said NBC News chief data analyst Steve Kornacki. But he likened it to the 1986 midterms, when Democrats flipped Senate seats in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. It hardly heralded the party’s resurgence in the South, Kornacki recalled. “It was a blip.”

David Shor, a data scientist and consultant supporting candidates on the left, pushed back against those who argue Democrats need to run a white man in the next presidential election, noting that his metrics show women candidates often outperform men. Data and behavioral scientist Matt Oczkowski, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, predicted something of a “civil war” on the right, as establishment Republicans fight to win back the party’s soul. Enos and his co-organizers also assembled a panel to discuss the country’s youngest voters. Rachel Janfaza ’20, founder of the qualitative research firm The Up and Up, outlined her theory of “two Gen Zs,” separated by the pandemic’s disruption of K-12 education. Also highlighted were concerns about AI’s job market impacts and an emerging gender divide on marriage and children. Multiple panelists grappled with the state of political polling, with support for President Trump underestimated in three consecutive cycles. They discussed whether artificial intelligence could help pollsters reach more independent and Republican voters or if interviewers should try doubling down on in-person methods. Polling before last year’s general election was still more accurate than historic averages, noted CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten. “The problem is,” he said, “we have had more elections in a row, at least in the popular vote, that were determined by single digits than at any point since we first started recording the popular vote in 1824.”

At the end of the film, Cade’s emotions are enigmatic because there was never a strong sense of his boundaries or desires beyond being a great USFF player. Characterization is a struggle across many characters. Besides White’s trusted doctor, most secondary characters are not well incorporated, making threats against them in the film unmoving. Primary characters like White and his wife Elsie (Julia Fox), who rises in prominence throughout the film, have confounding dynamics with football and each other. First, White’s determination to continue playing and obsession with football seems completely self-inspired. Elsie at first seems to live in her own world with her own aspirations, using her WAG status to launch her own peculiar ventures. By the end of the film, Elsie appears to be the mastermind behind the conflict of the film while White’s role becomes ambiguous, a striking change that is poorly, if at all, developed across the film. The film attempts commentary that criticizes team owners and exploitative agents through depiction of the Saviors’ owners and Cade’s agent. Unfortunately, their malice is not well intertwined throughout the film, making their role in its conflict feel like an afterthought. Despite faults in the material, Wayans and Withers give standout performances. Both beautifully capture the intensity and determination it takes to play football at a professional level.

Religious allusions follow the main characters Cade and White throughout the film through cross earrings, chains, and of course, the team name, The Saviors. Throughout the film, Kira Kelly masterfully uses light to establish Cade as a Christ-like figure, surrounding him with golden light in contrast to the film's antagonist. In a particularly beautiful moment, Cade is seated at the center of a long table with golden halo lights above him while twelve reporters sit around him, emulating Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting, “The Last Supper.”

2025-11-10T22:01:37.401955Z	Though visually appealing and innovative, writer and director Justin Tipping’s “Him” sacrifices intricacy as it tries to do a little bit of everything, leaving the new release unfocused and rough around the edges. “Him” follows star college quarterback Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers) as he makes a bid for the USFF, the film’s version of the NFL, intent on following the footsteps of his longtime inspiration, legendary quarterback Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans). After a traumatic head injury takes him out of the scouting combine, he is given another opportunity at the league by completing a week-long bootcamp with White. Little does he know, there are darker pathways to success than running drills. The film opens on a young Cade and his family watching White succumb to a career-altering injury while scoring a game winning touchdown for his USFF team, The Saviors. Immediately, candles, crosses, and Christian symbols establish the importance of religion in Cade’s family. Once White enters the endzone, the candles go out. Cade watches White’s fractured leg dangle as his father’s cross chain hangs in front of his face. Unfortunately, this opening sequence does a little too well in establishing the film’s protagonist and antagonist. The religious symbolism surrounding Cameron and his family being disturbed by White feels obvious and leaves little opportunity for the story’s conflict to be discovered. This is a problem that reoccurs during the film: The twists in plot and revelations of antagonistic characters lack shock factor because of overt symbolism and foreshadowing. In parts of the film, characters’ dialogue attempt to subvert suspicions, but their guilt is so conspicuous that the words seem out of place. This is not to say there was no subtle imagery.

He also voiced support for the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision overturning the Chevron doctrine, which had given regulators a powerful voice in interpreting and filling in gaps in laws passed by Congress. Pence said that his Christian faith has been a powerful motivator for him in public life and that he believes that democracy requires that the people share a common moral order. He also affirmed the First Amendment’s religious freedom clauses. He traced to his faith his belief that civility in politics is not just a courtesy to opponents, but an important feature that allows people to meet across differences. “Democracy depends on heavy doses of civility,” he said. “When we’re civil with one another, even when we disagree, we have the opportunity to find common cause, not compromising principles or core values, but actually finding ways to work together to advance the country.”

2025-11-10T21:59:57.591687Z	Specifically, Pence said that the U.S. should help put Ukraine in a better position to defeat Russia. Otherwise, he said, the risk of a third world war will rise. “Anyone who thinks yielding to a rapacious dictator avoids World War III needs to study World War II,” Pence said. “In my judgment, Vladimir Putin won’t stop until he’s stopped.”
2025-11-10T21:59:57.591683Z	The U.S. is irreplaceable on the world stage because there’s no other allied nation that other countries will follow, Pence said, linking his own recent run for president to his sense that Donald Trump and others in the GOP were stepping back from global leadership. “What drew me into my brief but memorable campaign back in 2023 was that I saw my old running mate and many in our party departing from those core ideals and principles,” Pence said. “If America isn’t leading the free world, the free world is not being led. There is no B team, no backup country that steps into that gap.”

2025-11-10T21:59:57.591670Z	Pence spoke at the Kennedy School during an event hosted by the Institute of Politics and moderated by Archon Fung, director of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. It came months after Pence was awarded the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in Boston for his role certifying the 2020 election results as rioters surrounded the U.S. Capitol.
2025-11-10T21:59:57.591665Z	Former Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that signs of diminished U.S. support for longtime allies have left him worried about conflict and strife akin to one of the deadliest eras in world history. “I think we’re living in a very perilous time where America needs to be strong, we need to be ready, we need to stand with our allies, and we need to make it clear to enemies of freedom that — as President Kennedy said — we will bear any burden, pay any price to ensure the survival of liberty,” Pence said. “We stay strong, we stay unwavering, make it clear to people that we’re going to defend our interests and our allies in the world, and we got a shot at a peaceful future. Failing that, I think the second half of the 21st century could look a whole lot more like the first half of the 20th century.”

2025-11-10T21:59:57.591645Z	He added: “I have confidence in the days ahead that Republicans and Democrats will hew to those roots and to that duty.”
2025-11-10T21:59:57.591640Z	Recalling Jan. 6, Pence said, “Many around the world were watching and I think they saw the resilience of our institutions and the strength of our institutions.”
2025-11-10T21:59:57.591636Z	Fung thanked Pence for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence refused to bow to pressure from President Trump and the protesters invading the Capitol as Congress gathered to certify Joe Biden’s election victory. He also asked the former vice president about his faith in the durability of U.S. institutions.

2025-11-10T21:59:57.591622Z	Pence said that his Christian faith has been a powerful motivator for him in public life and that he believes that democracy requires that the people share a common moral order. He also affirmed the First Amendment’s religious freedom clauses.
2025-11-10T21:59:57.591617Z	Pence didn’t break with the current administration completely. He cited his support for lower taxes. He cast doubt on global warming prescriptions and insisted that climate solutions come from free market, rather than regulatory, approaches. He also voiced support for the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision overturning the Chevron doctrine, which had given regulators a powerful voice in interpreting and filling in gaps in laws passed by Congress.
