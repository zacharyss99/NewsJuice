{"chunk":"What will AI mean for humanity? Scholars from range of disciplines see red flags, possibilities ahead\nWhat does the rise of artificial intelligence mean for humanity? That was the question at the core of \u201cHow is digital technology shaping the human soul?,\u201d a panel discussion that drew experts from computer science to comparative literature last week. The Oct. 1 event was the first from the Public Culture Project, a new initiative based in the office of the dean of arts and humanities. Program Director Ian Marcus Corbin, a philosopher on the neurology faculty of Harvard Medical School, said the project\u2019s goal was putting \u201chumanist and humanist thinking at the center of the big conversations of our age.\u201d\n\u201cAre we becoming tech people?\u201d Corbin asked. The answers were varied\n\u201cWe as humanity are excellent at creating different tools that support our lives,\u201d said Nataliya Kos\u2019myna, a research scientist with the MIT Media Lab. These tools are good at making \u201cour lives longer, but not always making our lives the happiest, the most fulfilling,\u201d she continued, listing examples from the typewriter to the internet. Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, is the latest example of a tool that essentially backfires in promoting human happiness, she suggested. She shared details of a study of 54 students from across Greater Boston whose brain activity was monitored by electroencephalography after being asked to write an essay. One group of students was allowed to use ChatGPT, another permitted access to the internet and Google, while a third group was restricted to their own intelligence and imagination. The topics \u2014 such as \u201cIs there true happiness?\u201d \u2014 did not require any previous or specialized knowledge. The results were striking: The ChatGPT group demonstrated \u201cmuch less brain activity.\u201d In addition, their essays were very similar, focusing primarily on career choices as the determinants of happiness. The internet group tended to write about giving, while the third group focused more on the question of true happiness. Questions illuminated the gap. All the participants were asked whether they could quote a line from their own essays, one minute after turning them in. \u201cEighty-three percent of the ChatGPT group couldn\u2019t quote anything,\u201d compared to 11 percent from the second and third groups. ChatGPT users \u201cdidn\u2019t feel much ownership,\u201d of their work. They \u201cdidn\u2019t remember, didn\u2019t feel it was theirs.\u201d\n\u201cYour brain needs struggle,\u201d Kos\u2019myna said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bloom\u201d when a task is too easy.","article_id":"ac1129ddc0ae48aba22cd23e28eb9213","chunk_index":0,"title":"What will AI mean for humanity?","author":"Terry

{"chunk":"In order to learn and engage, a task \u201cneeds to be just hard enough for you to work for this knowledge.\u201d\nE. Glen Weyl, research lead with Microsoft Research Special Projects, had a more optimistic view of technology. \u201cJust seeing the problems disempowers us,\u201d he said, urging instead for scientists to \u201credesign systems.\u201d\nHe noted that much of the current focus on technology is on its commercial aspect. \u201cWell, the only way they can make money is by selling advertising,\u201d he said, paraphrasing prevailing wisdom before countering it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the only way this can be structured.\u201d\nCiting works such as Steven Pinker\u2019s new book, \u201cWhen Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows,\u201d Weyl talked about the idea of community \u2014 and how social media is more focused on groups than on individuals. \u201cIf we thought about engineering a feed about these notions, you might be made aware of things in your feed that come from different members of your community. You would have a sense that everyone is hearing that at the same time.\u201d\nThis would lead to a \u201ctheory of mind\u201d of those other people, he explained, opening our sense of shared experiences, like that shared by attendees at a concert. To illustrate how that could work for social media, he brought up Super Bowl ads. These, said Weyl, \u201care all about creating meaning.\u201d Rather than sell individual drinks or computers, for example, we are told \u201cCoke is for sharing. Apple is for rebels.\u201d\n\u201cCreating a common understanding of something leads us to expect others to share the understanding of that thing,\u201d he said. To reconfigure tech in this direction, he acknowledged, \u201crequires taking our values seriously enough to let them shape\u201d social

{"chunk":"Do our technologies extend our agency \u2014 or do they escape our control and control us? Can we have relationships with things that we or other human beings have created? What does it mean to say that some activity is merely technical, a craft or a skill, and when is it poesis\u201d or art? Looking at the influence of large language models in education, she said, \u201cI think and hope LLMs are creating an interesting occasion to rethink what is instrumental. They scramble our perception of what education is essential,\u201d she said. LLMs \u201callow us to ask how different we are from machines \u2014 and to claim the space to ask those questions.\u201d\nBrandon Vaidyanathan, a professor of sociology at Catholic University of America, also saw possibility. Vaidyanathan, the panel\u2019s first speaker, began by noting the difference between science and technology, citing the philosopher Martin Heidegger\u2019s concept of \u201cenframing\u201d has tech viewing everything as \u201cproduct.\u201d\nVaidyanathan noted that his experience suggests scientists take a different view. \u201cUnderlying what we might call scientific intelligence there is a deeper, spiritual intelligence \u2014 why things matter,\u201d he said. Instead of the \u201cdomination, extraction, and fragmentation\u201d most see driving tech (and especially AI), he noted that scientists tend toward \u201cthe three principles of spiritual intelligence: reverence, receptivity, and reconnection.\u201d More than 80 percent of them \u201cencounter a deep sense of respect for what they\u2019re studying,\u201d he said. Describing a researcher studying the injection needle of the salmonella bacteria with a \u201cdeep sense of reverence,\u201d he noted, \u201cYou\u2019d have thought this was the stupa of a Hindu temple. \u201cTech and science can open us up to these kind of spiritual experiences,\u201d Vaidyanathan continued. \u201cCan we imagine the development of technology that could cultivate a sense of reverence rather than domination?\u201d To do that, he concluded, might require a \u201cdisconnect on a regular
