Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). “We seem to be at this really catalytic moment in the world with regards to large language models and machine learning more generally. There’s a lot of work to be done making sure that this kind of technology is being developed in a way that’s smart and also sensitive to the ways in which it can go wrong and where there can be pitfalls.”\nFlintoft applied to the Rhodes Scholarship last August and was named a finalist for the one scholarship allocated to the Australian state of Victoria. He needed to complete two panel interviews — the first was virtual, but the second required a flight home.\n“Both rounds of interviews were with the full selection panel, which is composed of former Rhodes scholars who have gone on to do really fascinating, cool things, as well as really important figures in the Australian community,” he said.\nUnlike the process in the U.S. or other parts of the world, Flintoft found out the very same day that he’d been selected. That meant he got to celebrate with his family.\n“It was a really special experience, but very brief, because I had to hop back on a plane to get back to Boston literally a couple of hours later,” he said. “It was a very rushed experience amid the delirium of jet lag. A lot of time zone changes, but it was a really wonderful experience.”\nWhile most Rhodes Scholars receive their first graduate degrees at Oxford, Flintoft will arrive with one already completed. Applied math has provided him with tools to both deepen and better deploy his undergraduate education into the intersection of philosophy and technology.\n“For those that want to push that little extra mile and really sink our teeth into truly difficult grad classes, which are often literally at the forefront of research, that kind of experience is very special,” he said. “Applied math specifically is a wonderfully versatile degree. It has intersections in biology, economics, physics, computer science, a whole host of different disciplines.”\nAt Oxford, Flintoft is especially interested in the philosophical and societal implications of artificial intelligence and fundamental questions such as what it means to be human when AI can improve on or replace so much of human behavior.\n“There are going to be a whole host of really good benefits as a result of AI being deployed en masse in a society,” Flintoft said. “Productivity increases, and there’ll be benefits to people’s lives and livelihoods because there’ll be a whole bunch of quite complex services that will be a lot cheaper. But the important thing is that the transformation is done right, because AI will catalyze and accelerate. It’s important that that acceleration happens in the right direction.”\nFlintoft’s time at Harvard reflects broad interdisciplinary interests. His extracurricular activities include being managing editor of the Harvard Review of Philosophy and editorial chair of the Harvard Undergraduate Law Review.\nHe is also a researcher in the Soft Math Lab of L. Mahadevan, Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics, of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and of Physics at SEAS, where he studies complex behaviors in biology, such as the mathematics behind control of muscular hydrostats such as octopus arms.\nFlintoft’s research raises philosophical questions about consciousness and conscious decision-making — questions Flintoft might very well get to answer over the next two years.\n“I’ll get the chance to hone my interests a little bit more in these two areas that are really important to me,” he said. “Additionally, the Rhodes Scholarship is designed to immerse scholars in a community of other scholars who are also all public service-oriented and really want to maximize the impact that their study can have on the world. I think that connection between what we learn in the classroom and the way that we then go on to bring good into the world is really important.”", "published_at": "2025-10-09T20:05:04+00:00", "fetched_at": "2025-10-09T22:10:45.222858+00:00", "source_link": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/feed/", "source_type": "RSS", "summary": ""}
{"author": "Terry Murphy", "title": "What will AI mean for humanity?", "content": "What will AI mean for humanity?\nScholars from range of disciplines see red flags, possibilities ahead\nWhat does the rise of artificial intelligence mean for humanity? That was the question at the core of “How is digital technology shaping the human soul?,” a panel discussion that drew experts from computer science to comparative literature last week.\nThe Oct. 1 event was the first from the Public Culture Project, a new initiative based in the office of the dean of arts and humanities. Program Director Ian Marcus Corbin, a philosopher on the neurology faculty of Harvard Medical School, said the project’s goal was putting “humanist and humanist thinking at the center of the big conversations of our age.”\n“Are we becoming tech people?” Corbin asked. The answers were varied\n“We as humanity are excellent at creating different tools that support our lives,” said Nataliya Kos’myna, a research scientist with the MIT Media Lab. These tools are good at making “our lives longer, but not always making our lives the happiest, the most fulfilling,” she continued, listing examples from the typewriter to the internet.\nGenerative AI, specifically ChatGPT, is the latest example of a tool that essentially backfires in promoting human happiness, she suggested.\nShe shared details of a study of 54 students from across Greater Boston whose brain activity was monitored by electroencephalography after being asked to write an essay.\nOne group of students was allowed to use ChatGPT, another permitted access to the internet and Google, while a third group was restricted to their own intelligence and imagination. The topics — such as “Is there true happiness?” — did not require any previous or specialized knowledge.\nThe results were striking: The ChatGPT group demonstrated “much less brain activity.” In addition, their essays were very similar, focusing primarily on career choices as the determinants of happiness.\nThe internet group tended to write about giving, while the third group focused more on the question of true happiness.\nQuestions illuminated the gap. All the participants were asked whether they could quote a line from their own essays, one minute after turning them in.\n“Eighty-three percent of the ChatGPT group couldn’t quote anything,” compared to 11 percent from the second and third groups. ChatGPT users “didn’t feel much ownership,” of their work. They “didn’t remember, didn’t feel it was theirs.”\n“Your brain needs struggle,” Kos’myna said. “It doesn’t bloom” when a task is too easy. In order to learn and engage, a task “needs to be just hard enough for you to work for this knowledge.”\nE. Glen Weyl, research lead with Microsoft Research Special Projects, had a more optimistic view of technology. “Just seeing the problems disempowers us,” he said, urging instead for scientists to “redesign systems.”\nHe noted that much of the current focus on technology is on its commercial aspect. “Well, the only way they can make money is by selling advertising,” he said, paraphrasing prevailing wisdom before countering it. “I’m not sure that’s the only way this can be structured.”\nCiting works such as Steven Pinker’s new book, “When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows,” Weyl talked about the idea of community — and how social media is more focused on groups than on individuals.\n“If we thought about engineering a feed about these notions, you might be made aware of things in your feed that come from different members of your community. You would have a sense that everyone is hearing that at the same time.”\nThis would lead to a “theory of mind” of those other people, he explained, opening our sense of shared experiences, like that shared by attendees at a concert.\nTo illustrate how that could work for social media, he brought up Super Bowl ads. These, said Weyl, “are all about creating meaning.” Rather than sell individual drinks or computers, for example, we are told “Coke is for sharing. Apple is for rebels.”\n“Creating a common understanding of something leads us to expect others to share the understanding of that thing,” he said.\nTo reconfigure tech in this direction, he acknowledged, “requires taking our values seriously enough to let them shape” social media. It is, however, a promising option.\nMoira Weigel, an assistant professor in comparative literature at Harvard, took the conversation back before going forward, pointing out that many of the questions discussed have captivated humans since the 19th century.\nWeigel, who is also a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, centered her comments around five questions, which are also at the core of her introductory class, “Literature and/as AI: Humanity, Technology, and Creativity.”\n“What is the purpose of work?” she asked, amending her query to add whether a “good” society should try to automate all work. “What does it mean to have, or find, your voice? Do our technologies extend our agency — or do they escape our control and control us? Can we have relationships with things that we or other human beings have created? What does it mean to say that some activity is merely technical, a craft or a skill, and when is it poesis” or art?\nLooking at the influence of large language models in education, she said, “I think and hope LLMs are creating an interesting occasion to rethink what is instrumental. They scramble our perception of what education is essential,” she said. LLMs “allow us to ask how different we are from machines — and to claim the space to ask those questions.”\nBrandon Vaidyanathan, a professor of sociology at Catholic University of America, also saw possibility.\nVaidyanathan, the panel’s first speaker, began by noting the difference between science and technology, citing the philosopher Martin Heidegger’s concept of “enframing” has tech viewing everything as “product.”\nVaidyanathan noted that his experience suggests scientists take a different view.\n“Underlying what we might call scientific intelligence there is a deeper, spiritual intelligence — why things matter,” he said.\nInstead of the “domination, extraction, and fragmentation” most see driving tech (and especially AI), he noted that scientists tend toward “the three principles of spiritual intelligence: reverence, receptivity, and reconnection.” More than 80 percent of them “encounter a deep sense of respect for what they’re studying,” he said.\nDescribing a researcher studying the injection needle of the salmonella bacteria with a “deep sense of reverence,” he noted, “You’d have thought this was the stupa of a Hindu temple.\n“Tech and science can open us up to these kind of spiritual experiences,” Vaidyanathan continued.\n“Can we imagine the development of technology that could cultivate a sense of reverence rather than domination?” To do that, he concluded, might require a “disconnect on a regular basis.”", "published_at": "2025-10-09T18:46:38+00:00", "fetched_at": "2025-10-09T22:10:45.222858+00:00", "source_link": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/feed/", "source_type": "RSS", "summary": ""}
{"author": "Terry Murphy", "title": "Tai Tsun Wu, 90", "content": "At a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Oct. 7, 2025, the following tribute to the life and service of the late Tai Tsun Wu was spread upon the permanent records of the Faculty.\nProfessor Tai Tsun Wu was a formidable member of both the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the Department of Physics at Harvard. At the age of 22, his ground-breaking research on antenna theory under the direction of Professor Ronold W. P. King established him as one of the leading experts in this important field. The remarkable breadth of Wu’s research interests over the course of his career was underpinned by his exceptional mathematical abilities. Although he shifted the main thrust of this research to fundamental problems in physics, he continued for years to be active in solving basic electricity and magnetism problems that arise in antenna theory.\nDuring Wu’s subsequent productive career, he pursued a long collaboration with Hung Cheng, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Their extraordinary study of the high-energy behavior in quantum field theory illuminated properties of renormalization theory and resulted in the prediction of rising total cross-section of hadron scattering. Wu’s work on statistical mechanics models with Barry McCoy, Craig Tracy, and others led to different insights, including finding a closed-form solution for correlation functions of the scaling limit of the Ising model, ostensibly an exact quantum field theory. In 1975 Wu collaborated with C.N. Yang to reformulate the theory of monopoles, leading to what is now referred to as the “Wu-Yang dictionary.” Professor Wu advised many graduate students and had numerous collaborators, including John Myers.\nWu’s research led to his recognition in many ways. Among other achievements, he received the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Prize. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and to the Academia Sinica. Wu taught courses in applied mathematics and in physics in the Department of Physics and in SEAS. He was known to students and colleagues as an accessible expert on mathematical methods. Wu shunned the limelight and the pursuit of recognition; rather, he constantly focused on his research. For this reason, despite the fact that he authored over 400 publications, including six books, his work is not as widely known as it should be.\nWu was born on Dec. 1, 1933, in Shanghai, China. He came to the United States to study as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, where, in 1953, he won the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. This national competition for undergraduates has a Harvard connection: it was established by Elizabeth Lowell Putnam in honor of her husband and it offers a Harvard graduate school scholarship to one of the top winners each year. Wu applied to Harvard as the first Putnam Fellow from the University of Minnesota. A story that is still told is that members of the Department of Mathematics had naturally assumed that young Wu would be joining them, but he had applied to study applied physics. His doctoral thesis led to his election to the Society of Fellows at the age of 22 and to his appointment in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences at age 25, where he remained until 2021, when he became an emeritus professor.\nWu was fond of several local Chinese restaurants, where many friends were his guests for lunch or dinner. One of these guests recalled being feasted by Wu with a dinner that included chicken feet, an unusual experience. Wu expressed his generosity in many other ways. One new faculty member arrived at Harvard without a car just as Wu was about to leave for a sabbatical. Wu insisted that his young colleague drive his Dodge Dart until he returned.\nWhile at Harvard, Wu became acquainted with Sau Lan Yu, a graduate student in experimental physics. They married on June 18, 1967, in the Harvard Memorial Church. Sau Lan went on to become distinguished for her role in the discovery of the J/𝜓 particle with Samuel Ting at Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as for leading many experiments with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The Wu family spent much time both in Cambridge and Europe. In 2022 they sold their Cambridge house and moved to Palo Alto, California, where Wu died in the Stanford University hospital on July 19, 2024.\nRespectfully submitted,\nHung Cheng (MIT)\nSheldon Glashow\nJohn Hutchinson\nArthur Jaffe, Chair\nPortions of this Minute were previously published: Arthur Jaffe, “Tai Tsun Wu (1933-2024),” Department of Physics’ website, July 23, 2024, https://www.physics.harvard.edu/news/tai-tsun-wu-1933-2024 [accessed Aug. 11, 2025].", "published_at": "2025-10-09T13:36:09+00:00", "fetched_at": "2025-10-09T22:10:45.222858+00:00", "source_link": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/feed/", "source_type": "RSS", "summary": ""}
